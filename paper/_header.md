    The CABbAGE project aims to improve sleep though using a AI
    generated pink noise, variable frequency noise generated to promote
    better sleep. Given the novel research surrounding sleep and
    white/pink noise. As a type of pink noise, through personal
    findings the project aims to experiment with podcast-like noise and
    compare it sleep-performance of standard white and pink noise. To generate the audio, CABbAGE uses a range of generative techniques like LSTM and Markov Models trained on a variety of seed data ranging from Science and Tech, Zen and Nature and Sports.
