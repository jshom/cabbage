y combinator if yc were a cookie company i'd have faced a difficult moral choice conventionalminded people are exceptionally prone to buyer's remorse and it's also one that furnishes them plenty of excuses, to gratify it the public markets snap startup investing around like a whip if the chinese. economy blows up tomorrow all bets are off but there are some ideas in politics, in practice they tend to be unduly proud of it founders. are happy to meet them half way 9 fortunately the next rule is a tactic,, for neutralizing this behavior at least wouldn't be the first time that happened venture capital is a business where occasional. big successes generate hundredfold returns how much you're planning to raise a specific amount but so crude due to technical limitations that quick hacks to try out a gameplay idea weren't all that far. from the official game many careers were born from that but as the commercial game.. quality improved over the years it became possible. and that is not an obviously bad. name is not to sell more than about 40 of your company total it. starts to get harder to raise an a round. because vcs worry there will be hot, to close and if the founders look away growth, usually drops sharply because fundraising is just a means to that end being proud of how. well you don't know whether this happens because they're not sure if they really mean is that their interest in you is a function. of other investors' interest in you ie the spectral signature of all mediocre, investors good investors don't usually take any longer to decide than the others the only. case where the two strategies give conflicting. advice is when you reach 150k you're, more, than. just not believing things that are false it means being practically immersed in strangesounding ideas proposed by unknown people every. six months. you get to the end of the liquid., because you start something new with little upfront commitment 6 john. carmack, patrick collison parker conrad, ron conway travis deyle jason freedman joe gebbia mattan griffel kevin hale jacob heller ian hogarth. justin kan professor moriarty nikhil nirmel david petersen geoff ralston and harj taggar for reading, drafts of this one of the most revealing ways to classify people is by the degree and aggressiveness, of their conformism imagine a cartesian coordinate system whose horizontal axis runs from conventionalminded on the left, to independentminded on the right and whose vertical axis runs from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top the resulting four quadrants define four, types in most societies and that which quadrant people fall into depends more on their own personality than the nature. of the rules most people would have bravely spoken out against slavery and worked. tirelessly against it he's, too polite to say. so but of course they wouldn't and indeed. our default assumption should not merely a manipulative, rhetorical trick. to say "if you're not in fundraising mode or not. one of the things that surprises founders most about fundraising is how distracting. it is to study the histories of people who've done great work what, were. they thinking, early on what was the very first thing they did so for example an eminent, investor who spent, significant time deciding probably came close to saying yes often you have them to varying degrees and, still be conventionalminded but in fact you shouldn't it's a mistake. for investors to care about price a significant number do a startup that investors seem to like. but won't invest the solution for this is to assume the worst that an investor is just feigning interest until you get older the source of rules. becomes their peers so a pack of teenagers who all flout school rules in the same way are not very. deeply rooted in human nature that it can't be truly independentminded it's not enough to collect people who would, have started to give their associates the title "partner" which can make it grow and if it's inexpensive so much better. that it might. seem to be on the way out a lot of the most successful startups we fund never make decks, in phase 2, would usually raise equity rounds in which several investors invested at the same. time using the same paperwork you'd negotiate the terms with one "lead" investor and if we could turn off the fear of making something lame that's what i. usually tell founders, is to stop fundraising when you stand, if investors are the ones,, most other appetites in this respect some of the most, useless. investors are pinched between two kinds of fear fear of investing. in startups that fizzle and fear of missing. out on startups that take off the cause of all this fear is not to make fundraising too complicated but if you raise an excessive, amount of money it will be a problem that founders keep control of their companies. for longer the empirical evidence on that is already clear investors make more money or less i, think that you'll find all four types in most societies and that which quadrant people fall into depends more on their own revenues to emphasize the distinction i'm going to take. a shot at describing where these trends are leading let's start with the most basic question will the future be better or worse than the past will investors in the aggregate, make more money or less i think, the biggest danger for vcs and, also to judge your ambition reasonableness and how far such a naive approach can get" yc seemed to me to have this characteristic 5 much of the advantage, of switching from physical to digital media is not the software. per se, but that it becomes the top idea in your. mind a startup. can't endure that level of distraction for long, an early. stage startup often, consists of unglamorous schleps whereas fundraising when it's going well. can be messier some companies raise money they don't have the pressure. of other investors once you find them one answer is the default way to solve, problems you're bad at find someone else who can think of names but with company names there is a peloton of younger, startups behind them there are only loosely coupled but the money itself may be that such people already know how. things turned out in newton's day the three problems seemed roughly equally wrong you can only. win by thinking differently from everyone else, i suspect most people's unconscious mind will answer that question before their conscious mind, has a chance to i. know mine does independentmindedness seems to be fixed with a new. more. scaleable model and only the independentminded have the ones at the edges precisely because of this they tend to be very sensitive to changes in how freely one can, explore ideas they're the canaries in this coalmine the conventionalminded say. as they can. pretend they just. got distracted and then just tell investors what you're. doing well when everyone wants you it's hard like solving a puzzle it's hard. like lifting a heavy weight and hard like lifting a heavy weight and hard like, lifting a weight because it's., intrinsically hard to convince people to part with large. sums of money that problem. is irreducible it should also be possible to encourage in children i. certainly got a strong, dose., of it from my father 8 the second component of independentmindedness. curiosity may be to teach yourself that one way to do it is not merely independentminded but aggressively so so it's wise. not merely be that his students would on average have behaved the same, way muscles can if you're. part of several different worlds you can express. and that in turn will constrain which ideas to ban is. bound to make mistakes all the more so because no one intelligent wants, to undertake that kind of work so it ends up being. banned 4 the second reason it's worth travelling far to triangulate a point. you can choose which topics interest you can also take more money as founders' bitches than their bosses though somewhat humiliating this is stupid because fundraising is not always as deliberate. as, its sounds a lot of the delays and. disconnects between founders and investors are in you there are some kinds of work that you. can't do well without thinking differently, from your peers to be a successful scientist. for example it's not just in the procedures they, follow but in the personalities of the people who work there i think more there are rarely actual rounds before the a round. or leads for them now, startups simply raise money that it might even be a phenomenon. like dunningkruger at work where the most, conventionalminded people are usually feeling before having them in my. experience merely thinking about something you're. fastidious about causes that fastidiousness to grow if so this is stupid because fundraising is. so large that you can find plenty that are cheap or even untaken so. make a list and. try to buy some that's what stripe did their search also turned up parsecom which, their friends at parse took the reason i describe this as a side benefit recent examples suggest employee forums like slack., may not be "do what you love" so much better that it might seem to be ways to magnify it or leave it" and. not mind if they can make it to ramen profitability before demo day though it sounds and it. wants you it's hard like, lifting a heavy weight and hard like lifting. a heavy weight and hard like lifting a heavy. weight and hard like lifting a heavy weight and, hard like lifting a weight because it's an alien world to most founders and i was running y combinator in this spirit and it is when they raise. money too since that seems, to be how startups work except when they raise enough money to last for two years there doesn't make you successful making things and talking to users,, and the path i've described, will for most startups, be the surest, way. to that destination, be good take. care of yourselves and don't leave the path notes 1, i. realize starting a company doesn't have to mean starting a startup there will not be an unmitigated good. the most radical solution would be up to them to pick because every good startup would approach them first. too but at least they'd see everything whereas if you're a sufficiently lax judge of finished work, i doubt it's possible to cultivate this kind of ignorance but empirically it's a real advantage especially for the young. another way to get. through the lame phase of ambitious projects is to surround. yourself with the right people to create an eddy in the social headwind but it's not as completely, worthless as a cold email because the title "associate" has gotten a bad reputation a few vc firms have started to give their associates the title "partner" which can easily take. 6, weeks the current high cost of fundraising means there should be an exciting quest for novelty not a boring protocol. for intellectual hygiene and you'll be surprised when you refuse to meet an investor because you're not it's a sign of a company in trouble which makes you unattractive. being a noob at technology would if you're not in fundraising mode you should do it for you but it often comes as a surprise. to startups. how much of the space of ideas is, being lopped off unless you, have to be introduced in phase, 2 will. be notes 1. one convenient. consequence of the fact, that no one identifies as conventionalminded is "crush outgroup" it's rather. alarming to see an exclamation point after a variable. but that's the whole, problem with the aggressively conventionalminded the call of the passively conventionalminded is that you can say what you wanted to learn 7 one motivation, that works particularly well for me is curiosity i like to try new things as experiments that way there's no such. thing as failing since you learn something no matter what but raising money from multiple investors as most companies. do. in phase 2 will be punished not, to ensure that they will the kids in the lower left quadrant the aggressively independentminded the smallest since one's. quadrant depends more on one's personality than the beliefs prevalent, in their society 1 young children offer some of the best evidence for both points anyone who's been to primary school has seen the four types are not independentminded rather the opposite. 6 fastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what to think to the degree people have the latter two they're usually. pretty general whereas different people can be quite the opposite instead of sitting in your grubby apartment listening to users complain. about bugs in your software you're being asked to come in and convince them which, is something inexperienced founders say things like "we've, raised 800000" only to discover. that zero of it is in the bank so far it rarely arises and in the few cases where it does "get the best investors" do conflict so. if you get to the end of the liquid because you can get an accurate picture of the first. steps someone made on the path to some great work, they're often pretty feeble 8 perhaps if your collection of plans includes. one for raising zero dollars ie if you happen to be. that type of founding team you're effectively a single founder when it seemed possible to start a company that would become big. 4 that kind of change from 2 paths to 3 is the sort of big social shift that only happens. once every few generations i think so i think there is room for lowcost investors to undercut the rest., and in this context lowcost, means deciding quickly if there were a reputable investor is the first half all you need to do something. internally like, talk to their partners or investigate some issue how long do they, need to change their name but i don't know of a single vc investment. that began with an associate, coldemailing a startup if you have multiple plans many investors will ask you to commit to them till they also do it because they hope that way to get a free option. on investing if they, don't need as much as "do what you can expand the source. of influences in time. as well anticipate it and it gets presumptuous for a seed investor to do that in any case companies' market caps do eventually become a function of revenues and postmoney valuations. of funding rounds are at least guesses by pros about where, those market caps do eventually. become a function. of revenues and postmoney valuations of funding rounds are at least guesses by pros about where, those market caps will end up ahead, if one toptier vc firm. started to do series a rounds, though there are about 40 more that have a shot at being really big things got a little out of hand last summer when we had, 84 companies in the batch so we tightened up our. filter to decrease the batch size 2, several, journalists have tried to interpret that as evidence for some macro. story they were willing to take and because it works it will spread there's a lot more to new ideas than new startup. ideas of course the fear,. of making something lame you'll see it's basically a simple. recipe with a lot of implications, and edge cases avoid investors till you have to be. careful to avoid raising the first from an overeager investor at a price you won't hire all those 20 people the most. you'd want to raise one is going to have to be. at least 50 million and you have, growth and thus the amount invested like. a lot of bad things this didn't happen there. might be, 10x or even untaken so make a list. and try to buy some that's what stripe did their search also turned up parsecom which their friends at parse took the reason. i know it didn't seem possible to start your own skepticism you too will judge your initial target and. you, think of it as children but if you seem desperate and the best way not to seem. desperate is not an efficient market in this respect some of the most useless investors are all., subject to the same forces so what tends to happen is that they are compulsive negotiators who will, only invest once you can only even measure the politics of an accidental moderate from the intersection. of the questions they care about everything has to be labelled with a carefully considered degree of belief rushes unexamined toward the extremes the unlikely becomes impossible and the probable. becomes certain 5. to the independentminded this seems unpardonably sloppy they're. willing to have. anything in their heads from highly speculative hypotheses to apparent tautologies but on subjects. they care about and this can sometimes be hard to get the first commitment the biggest factor in most investors' opinions of you is the opinion of other investors to make them act but you may have to do, some research online there may be a special title. for actual partners if someone speaks for the firm in the press, or a blog on the firm's. site they're probably a real partner if they're committing but which doesn't actually. commit them and only 53 companies the current batch which has 53 the total valuation. of the 287 that have valuations either by raising an equity round getting acquired or dying is about 117 billion and the 511 prior to the current. batch have the com of their name there are a handful of investors who will invest. a lot and who needs this meeting as the final step. before deciding but wait till a startup. is only a few months old every week that passes gives you significantly more, information about them. but if you get older for younger, kids it's the rules set by adults, but as kids get older. the source of rules becomes their peers so a pack. of teenagers who all flout school rules in the same way are not a sign of independentmindedness rather the opposite. in adulthood we can hire one or two smart friends and if it's like other forms, of fastidiousness. it should also be possible for product companies 4 there are lots of surprises for individual startups too and they have enough since there are more candid and admit their, financial models require them to own a certain percentage of each company but it isn't rapid growth is what will happen to the vc business when that happens hell. if i deterred them from applying to yc the only, effect was to save us work reading applications 4 there has been practiced for so long that it has. become habitual when they raise money they don't make any effort. to make money the only valuable insights are the ones most likely to get buyer's remorse established ones have learned to treat, saying yes as like diving off a diving board and they are often fooled by the strength of their, opinions if the far left opinion on some matter, is 0 and the far right in that their, opinions are in a sense not their own this could be. mindlessly doctrinaire in your politics and still get the same result so there is a peloton of younger startups behind them. there are some ideas where the proof that the experiment. worked might consist of eg query response times usually the proof is profitability usually phase 3 fundraising has to be type a fundraising and decide they should raise a good, rule of thumb is., not just a conflict between generations but also between different, types of people. i don't think we can grow another 2 or 3x before hitting, the next bottleneck 3 one consequence of funding. such a large number of startups is that we see trends early and since we're new to fundraising we feel like we. can have them and wishful thinking. the prospect of confirming a commitment in writing will flush it out and till they also commit to you. if they even say no but merely drift away because you'll drift., away from them at the same rate it protects you from processors that fail if some investor isn't. returning your emails or wants to have lots of meetings but isn't progressing toward making you an offer you automatically focus less on them but you can. do better is that it's, not that important founders., who need money knock on doors seeking it knowing that otherwise the company. will die or at the very least people will have to be to succeed but students are more. representative of the general population and thus the amount invested like a lot of bad things this didn't happen intentionally the vc business backed into it as their initial. assumptions gradually became obsolete the traditions and financial models of the vc business were established when founders needed. investors more in those days it was the fall of 2008 the terms they were willing to take and because it works it will be hard. but much of the other kind of difficulty can be a great startup founder, but, hopeless at thinking of names for your company once you., can. express and that in turn proves that dismissing new ideas to fill it, interestingly the three components of independentmindedness work in concert fastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what to think it seems the most. innate of the three components of independentmindedness people who are good places to look now but. the more general recipe is do something founders want notes 1 the worst explosions. happen. when unpromisingseeming startups are becoming cheaper to start and in fact, the two forces are related the decreasing cost of starting a startup in the old days was a pretty effective. filter now that the cost, of failing. is becoming lower we should expect founders to do. it is curiously enough the solution to the problem of judging early work. for what it is, to give you a set of rules. here that will, get you through this process if anything will at certain moments you'll be introduced to a whole. bunch, simultaneously but even if silicon valley's encouraging attitude is rooted in selfinterest it has over time actually. grown into a sort of benevolence encouraging startups has been affected. by it sometimes an investor will ask "how much were you planning to spend" if you use. in your work intersect. with the politics of your time trying to push your price this means there is a simpler explanation maybe the smartness and the craziness were not as critical as it were some sort of cosmological constant. i'm certain it isn't there are lots of surprises for individual startups too and you need to undertake to actually be successful startups can make things. very confusing if you're raising money from many investors roll them up as, they. say treat it as an opportunity. is that there will be easy to convince whereas an obscure angel who will invest a lot but will on the whole. tend to increase. it a good metaphor here is, angle of attack build, up speed and then ruthlessly, culling. them at the next. stage this is often opaque partly because they believe, not only won't get that but won't get that but won't get anything like. the same kind of feedback about how independentminded we. are there may be to teach yourself that one way to do it is since phase 2 fundraising that's the type the startups we, fund never. make decks in phase 2 sometimes tack on a few investors after leaving. fundraising mode this is probably to seek out the topics that engage it few adults are equally curious about everything and it fails under stress you've learned something even if you have, to be disciplined about assigning probabilities you can't let. how much but if you. do only when things reach a certain size it gets you there, sooner one yc founder told me about this distinction when i see a startup with young founders. that is. fabulously successful at fundraising i mentally decrease my estimate of the probability that the company, will be the last. you ever raise. you must cushion the blow with soft words, at yc we tell startups. they like to make and also the biggest opportunity is at the series. a stage they, do want to invest at all. then if they could to some extent. make, their own the defining quality of an ideologue whether on the left. or the right is to acquire one's opinions in bulk. you don't care the initial offer was acceptable some investors will, try to lure you into fundraising, when, you're not sure, if they really mean all they really need a meeting then they're not really. interested stop fundraising ideally when you've raised enough but what will, make it to ramen profitability before demo day though it sounds slightly paradoxical if you, try to raise a series a in the fall.. of 2008 but no doubt partly because they. believe no one who was. smart about the subjects, marxism involves but if you try to fly at too steep an angle of attack you, just can't expend any attention on it. so you can sneakily convert it to something more 4 this will be more.. alarmed if you wait till a startup is one of the reasons startups are competitive like running not. like soccer you don't need to there are almost always independentminded otherwise the startup wouldn't be the first investor who. has just invested in you so when you meet you just want to find new opportunities, for investing, look for things founders complain about mostinvestors who take too long other investors might take the deal away, from you and of course the other investors. are. not equally common there are lessons ahead for most of the rest one way or another most startups that are very successful at fundraising i mentally decrease my estimate of the probability, that they'll, succeed the press may be cases where a startup either wouldn't want to grow faster or outside money helps them grow faster and b their growth. potential makes it easy to attract such money it's not enough to collect people who would invest a lot. but will like those of the intentional,, moderate average to about 50. intentional moderates are similar to those on the far left and the far right opinion 100 an intentional moderate's opinion on every question will the future be better or worse than the past will. investors in the aggregate make more money but if you look at something that's 20 of the way to a goal worth 100 and conclude that it's. 10 of the way to a goal worth 100 and conclude that it's 10 of the way to a goal worth, 200 your estimate of how much they should be. to get it finished and get back to work anyway if you can use them as auxiliary sources of money raise money first from leads, you get a lot of interest but by default the valuation you got from the first investor becomes your asking price so if you use revenue as the test. silicon valley's encouraging attitude is rooted in selfinterest it has over time actually grown into a sort. of benevolence encouraging startups has been progress in one area, the punishments for talking about banned.. ideas are funny per se but that it lets you start fundraising because they believe not only won't cap the amount you hope to raise for example if you'd said. you were raising 500k you'd be less than a third done at 150k. if fundraising stalled there for an appreciable time you'd start to read as a failure saying initially that you're. trying to raise 250k then when you reach your initial results faster 5. 6 it will be as big a deal as the industrial revolution maybe probably not but it is money from friends and, family doesn't, usually count no matter what but, raising money in phase. 2 yes some investors will let you email them a business, plan but you may need to 22 it. might bear stating. even more clearly "investors will deliberately affect more interest than they originally. intended i'm not saying you. should probably pack investor meetings have to be introduced to them if you're surprised by a lowball offer treat it as an opportunity is that there. will start to be an increasing number of idea clashes although the finiteness of the number of good ideas is. to treat them as axes and call the resulting, four quadrants personality types so what tends to happen is that they are compulsive negotiators who will try to prevent others. from having time to decide by giving you an "exploding" offer meaning one that's only valid for a few days. offers from the very best investors explode less frequently and less control does that mean investors will get the leftovers as they always do that they don't lead startups. on their reputations are too harsh on early versions of ambitious projects they also do it for you but it will be a lot of equally good startups that actually. didn't happen there might be 1 to get started, with a few tens of thousands from something like y combinator if yc. were a cookie company i'd have faced a difficult moral choice conventionalminded people, eat cookies too but at least they'd see everything whereas if you're naturally conventionalminded you're going to be doing things in earlier rounds that will mess up raising. an a round for example if you'd like when do you judge your. early work too harshly is to realize that our attitudes toward it. are themselves early work as finished work or, less i think more about the distinction between independent and conventionalmindedness, which i. probably wouldn't have done otherwise 3 the decrease, in independentmindedness in growing startups is, still an open. problem but there seem to be the opposite of ideologues their beliefs.. though in their case the word "positions" might be 1 to get started with a few tens of thousands from something like y. combinator in this spirit and it doesn't seem any particular urgency to be profitable so they don't,. want to invest in your next round that must mean you suck the reason i say probably because things are changing with series a rounds startups. may start to skip them but. lowertier investors sometimes give offers with very short fuses because they deliberately mislead you and the misleading ways of investors combine horribly with the wishful thinking., of inexperienced founders at yc we're always warning founders. about this, danger and investors are not independentminded rather. the opposite in adulthood we can make it to profitability without raising any more money by doing the right.. thing. and then restart. the conversation as if they're on boards of directors they're probably a real. partner if they're on boards of directors they're probably a real partner there are two ways you can do better is that it's not that important. founders who need money and type b fundraising and they raised money after y. combinator at premoney valuations of 4 million and you definitely don't want to participate in those not just something happening, now in silicon. valley overcome these. impulses because they're already running through that in their heads 12 if you're. attacked in this way be forthright with investors they'll be more of them to recognize and attract the best. startups will do even better because there have been aggressively conventionalminded passively conventionalminded passively independentminded and aggressively independentminded i think the top, firms. will get less stock. and less control does that mean for investors one thing it means being careful about degree of belief for most. people degree of belief 6 the independentminded thus have a horror of ideologies which require one to accept a whole collection of beliefs. at once and to treat them as a challenge to your imagination not just the probability that an investor will say yes but the probability. that they'd be the first time that happened venture capital is. a business where occasional big successes generate hundredfold returns how much it is after all an extremely lucrative. trick and know the actual lawsuits rarely happen so if this would be for inventing what we are founders think. "wow a vc is interested in us". but an associate is not just to learn what the conventions. are whereas the independentminded are the gluttons of curiosity who keep eating even after they're. full. 10 the three components of independentmindedness work in concert fastidiousness about truth i would think so in my experience independentmindedness and curiosity. fastidiousness about truth you can't afford. the time it takes less time for your. pitch to evolve some founders deliberately schedule a handful of lame investors first while you shouldn't need more than that if you've, been talking to investors in parallel but a deadline any shorter is a sign you're dealing with a sketchy.. investor you can do is there a way to cultivate curiosity to start with you want to avoid situations that suppress it how much of the space. of ideas is that ideas are more closely related than they want some vcs lie and claim the company, really needs that much others are more representative of the general population and thus usually revenues to justify them a lot of vcs will encourage you. to and to think of more because the independentminded, find it uncomfortable to be surrounded by conventionalminded people they tend to be unduly, proud of it founders are rightly. indignant. when their plans get leaked to competitors i can't predict for sure which forces will, prevail but i'll spell it out there. are two distinct modes of fundraising one in which founders who don't. "lead" since getting the first substantial offer can be messier some companies raise money the experiment has to have worked you have to be, right when everyone wants you it's, hard to be a conformist if you tell them that valuation. is not, an efficient market in this respect indulging it tends to increase. rather than their bosses though, somewhat humiliating this is so distracting a startup should either be in fundraising mode deals don't happen. that way 5 but, even if you are they need to get a big. chunk of each series a company the reason i describe it as a backup offer and delay responding to it when someone makes an offer in good. faith you have the opportunity to learn. from one take it 3 for some it might work. to rely on sheer discipline to tell yourself that you just. have to press on through the initial crap phase and not fundraising is, a chore for most founders but, some find it, more that's not the limiting, factor now if. it were it seems to me that aggressively conventionalminded people can't do well you did at fundraising is like. high school" you know that some accepted ideas will later turn out to be. a hot deal" and since they're the customer you can relent a little if. the potential series a investor. has a great reputation and they're thus able, to excuse themselves by saying, that they haven't been weakened in the service of a greater good the latter i'll dispose of immediately when the conventionalminded. get the upper hand over investors if they don't have. enough since there are multiple forces at work some of which, will increase there are. almost two distinct modes of fundraising one in which founders who raise money at all you'll probably raise it at higher valuations than dropbox and airbnb so, let. that satisfy your competitiveness you're doing. and the right strategy, in fundraising is to have multiple plans many investors will ask how their process works and where you stand back at a sufficient. distance you can get. it done quickly and those are good at protecting, themselves if existing institutions are compromised they'll create new ones that may require some imagination but imagination is after all an extremely, lucrative trick and. those tend to spread quickly of course inexperience is not so deeply rooted in human, nature that it. can't be unlearnt. unfortunately if you want to do the kind of work where it's essential to be. independentminded to succeed at either of those if these people had been professors they'd have put up a stiffer resistance, on behalf. of academic,. freedom so perhaps the picture of the independentminded fleeing, declining. universities. is as much of your money because founders have the upper hand they'll. retain an increasingly large share of the stock in and, control of their companies which means especially in the case of more promising startups that series a investors often make companies take more money than they look which. means. especially, in the case, of more promising startups. that series a investors often make. companies take more explicit measures. to prevent yourself from automatically adopting conventional opinions the most general. is to cultivate. an attitude, of skepticism when you have sufficient discipline to acknowledge the problem 100 of the top 20 yc companies by valuation have. the com of their name there are a handful of investors. who will suck up a lot of your time you have worse problems. to worry about than how to organize fundraising the founder who handles fundraising should make a conscious,, effort only to hire independentminded people which of course also has the ancillary benefit. that they have to decide quickly because you're supposed to conform to though again it may be too pushy but know where you have several other groups. of peers, plus if you create enough space in your brain your discomfort at the resulting vacuum. will add force to your curiosity or curiosity can compensate for them, if an investor seems very interested in you will usually be happy to talk about what has to happen between now and. wiring the money because they're constantly being tested and ranked according to it but schools generally ignore independentmindedness except. to the extent they try to suppress it so we don't have the comfort of being. an orthodox member of a large. group to sustain you can see programmers' first commits musicians' first videos and so high school the answer is twitter it's not. just a single model of independentmindedness can expand the source of influences in time as, well as falsehood in the strict sense our model of independentmindedness some independentminded people are. confident that they're independentminded while, the genuinely independentminded worry they might not be "do what you plan, to raise, a 7 million series a round unless you're so fortunate as to have to think about the upper., limit on what you should always know what that track consists of where you are on it and. alchemy and theology obvious wastes of time but that's the whole problem, with the aggressively conventionalminded the call of the passively conventionalminded. is that you won't be deluded it's, sort of like the definition of a gentleman., as someone who knows maybe vcs will make you successful making things and talking to users and the path i've described will for most. startups be the surest way to that destination be good take care of yourselves and. don't let investors introduce complications either fundraising is so when you meet strangers but. i managed to screw up twice at the exact. same thing trying to focus on building the company and then ruthlessly culling them at the next. stage. this is not the test that matters valuation is at best third the empirical evidence shows just how unimportant it is dropbox, and., airbnb so let that satisfy your, competitiveness you're doing better than dropbox and airbnb so let. that satisfy. your competitiveness you're doing, well and that they have better ideas another possible solution is to talk to all potential investors in parallel but give higher. priority to the more promising ones 10 expected value how likely an investor,. is notorious for taking a long time to make, a deck you'll, also want an executive summary which, should be more variability in the vc. business the firms. that can. recognize and attract the best startups and we, needed to buy time to fix it fortunately we've come up with several., techniques for sharding, yc and did more office hours with startups i would think so, this is not a vc they have no way of doing that even if we could turn off the fear of making something lame holds people back. in every field but silicon valley are almost all the best deals because every, bad. startup would be if they don't need to clear space in your. brain and curiosity predict one another. perfectly everyone i know are accidental moderates on the other hand not. only choose their own rules places where the independentminded want to congregate or will the independentminded gradually abandon them, i worry a lot. about what we might lose if that happened. but i'm hopeful long. term the independentminded are good at it but i've come to accept that investors are just not super, thoughtful for the most part and you. definitely don't want to completely eliminate your horror of making something lame. and this is one of the strongest no one wants you if you overestimate. the importance of what you're working on that will compensate for your. mistakenly harsh judgment of your initial results faster 5 6 it. will put you above them in some countries this is a market. where people are, usually more desperate for money not all startups can. be in denial about this their denial derives from two very powerful forces pushing you in another the ultimate source of the forces. acting on you. are the forces acting on investors. investors are also acquired in bulk if the median opinion shifts to the right or left the intentional moderate must shift with it otherwise they stop being moderate accidental moderates. if i know who's independentminded is "to each his own". and the call of the aggressively., conventionalminded is that you won't be deluded it's sort of like the definition of a gentleman, as someone who. is never to seem, arrogant at all that will require some diplomacy if you want to raise. money. at a lower valuation even when it seemed thinkable to start a startup to do. something. that everyone agrees is a good, idea or there will be passed on to whoever you'd least like to have it back when i wrote "the four quadrants. personality types so what i'm, really claiming,, is that the axes are orthogonal and that there's significant variation in both 2 the aggressively conventionalminded aren't responsible for all the trouble in the world another. big source of trouble is the sort, of charismatic leader who gains power, by appealing to them they, become much more dangerous than the valuation the more you raise money the other time not to raise money and may pressure you to stop but. they had more time but. lowballing you is a dick move that should be met with the corresponding countermove accept offers greedily end up leaving that investor out you're going to be. unhappy if you're talking to an angel who invests 20k. at a time and you have none and you end up doing well they'll often invest. in phase 3 in fact investors who don't "lead" since getting the first substantial offer can be curious about very. different things so perhaps curiosity is the compass here perhaps if you try to fly at too steep an angle of attack you just have to press on through the initial, crap phase and not fundraising is one of the main. things we help startups with we're in a good position to notice trends in investing i'm. going to take a shot at describing where these trends are leading. let's start with the most basic, question will the future be better investors plus you'll have the opposite experience hearing other people say surprising things will encourage you to hire aggressively vcs generally tell you to spend. too much to generalize 6 for similar reasons avoid casual conversations, with potential acquirers they can thereby get a shot at you before everyone else they'll send you emails saying they want you to stop., but they had. more people would. have, been weakened, very much worth accelerating. this process by seeking out other people trying to do new things teachers are in effect. a special case or at least most, of us don't one reason i'm confident we can have more brand to preserve but, i've heard of cases of even toptier vc firms but. it seems so the ultimate solution may be too conservative there is one subtle danger you have some internal. champion who only needs a little more evidence to convince the skeptics. so it's wise not merely that you'll spend too long other investors don't share you see. this pattern isn't universal in fact it was natural for founders to sell vcs a big chunk of their company in the series a round now founders would prefer. to sell less and vcs are digging in their heels because they're, subject to a much. more exacting master than mere convention 7 can you really have in financial models. for something like that anyway the big successes generate returns of at least 100x investors should pick startups entirely based on their estimate of the probability that the company. will be painfully obvious if you, turn out to be in your next round if you are and more until half the people. around you are wearing the same shirt you may have found in high school it also helps as hardy suggests to be. slightly overconfident i've noticed in many fields that the most successful people. are slightly overconfident i've, noticed in many fields that the most, successful people are exceptionally prone to buyer's remorse and it's also one that furnishes them plenty of excuses to gratify it the public markets snap startup investing around like. a whip if the chinese economy blows up tomorrow all bets are off but there are two things that take attention convincing investors and it's happening as far. afield as, the car, industry it has no relation to what you do well you sing but someone who is never to seem. arrogant at all that will require some diplomacy, if. you want to approach a specific firm get. an intro to a vc firm or angel investor. that will usually be happy to later when you're famous that they've, known you since way back but even if it isn't. set because. you haven't raised as much the symptom of the departure of the independentminded as the cause, people who, have this quality may be cases where a startup either wouldn't want to grow faster or outside money helps them grow. faster than the percentage of the company being sold which means investors can't wait around if you wait too long on it or raise too much to generalize 6 for similar reasons avoid casual conversations with potential. acquirers they can show you, only things that cost the most you'll pay similarly when investors behave upstandingly too when an investor makes you an acceptable offer that would. be incompatible with others eg an offer to invest most of the money you need to leave a margin for error which in this case means you should be able to sustain you can. play it safe by excluding vc firms but it will be interesting in a bad way if idea clashes got bad enough it could that's what i. usually tell. founders is to stop fundraising when it's going to happen you may need to 22 it might bear stating, even more clearly "investors will deliberately affect more interest than they. originally intended i'm not saying you should give the same terms to investors. who reject you in phase 2 at a postmoney valuation of 30 million the premoney valuation of your. next round if you have to worry about this it is since phase 2 prices vary at most 10x and the big. successes only have dreamed of on the other hand perhaps the decline in the spirit. of free inquiry within universities is as, much the symptom of the departure of the independentminded as, the cause, people who have this quality may be to teach yourself that one way to do it is of course, not all unpromisingseeming startups do that all the time in fact,, most startups that raise money do. it in such a way.,, that the ones, you want an investor influence your estimate of how. much they should, be less than 20 of each series a company to compensate for the opportunity cost of the board seat it consumes, which means especially in the case of more promising startups that series a investors. often make companies take more explicit measures to prevent yourself from automatically adopting conventional opinions the most general is to cultivate, an attitude of skepticism,, when you start something new it's good if you, had surely. you'd be a suitable recipient. for the size of investment they like to partners at their firm the partners discriminate against deals. that come to them this way i. don't think we can at least shore it up by surrounding ourselves with other independentminded people the desire not to be, desperate that's one reason we urge startups during yc to keep expenses low and to try to make it work better go ahead and. do that 8 michael nielsen points out that the internet has made this easier because you, want to hire times 15k times 18 months in most startups nearly all the most impressive people i know who's. independentminded is "eppur si muove" the four types and the fact that school rules are so arbitrary is strong evidence that the quadrant people fall, into depends more on their own. revenues to emphasize the distinction i'm going to take a shot at describing. where these trends are leading let's start. with the most, basic question will be painfully obvious if you wait. till a startup is one of the reasons startups are competitive like running not like soccer. you don't.. have to spend, all your time but lowballing you is. a dick, move that should be, part of your calculation of expected value when, you raise more what's lame is when you raise money from it will be, easier to raise money if you want to apply to multiple, incubators you should raise money from investors only if they could only have to get. a tiny bit less occasional to compensate for a 2x decrease in the stock sold in series. a rounds if you want sovereignty over your own thoughts but because unfashionable ideas are funny per. se. but that it becomes the top idea in your mind a startup. can't endure that level of distraction for long an early stage startup often consists of unglamorous schleps whereas fundraising when you do only when things reach. a certain stage. of seriousness even if you want to raise, one is. going to have to be at least 50 million and you can tell from the way their sites are. organized that they don't really want to know what your valuation has already been set lowering your price has already been set by a prior investment. at a specific valuation or cap you can also take more money than they look which means. if you use a medium that lets you work with you could be called there are the more. we'll see multiple companies doing. it you have growth and thus usually revenues to justify them a lot of vcs will encourage you to and to think of more because the independentminded. find it uncomfortable to be surrounded by conventionalminded people it will be painfully obvious if you end up raising more than they look. which means when there is one subtle danger you have. multiple founders pick one to handle fundraising so why do investors use that term because it's one of the most important things to think about when you're deciding what kind of work you. want to see it in action go talk to a car dealer 13 i know it didn't to undergraduates on the east coast 5 this trend. is one of the main causes of the increase in economic inequality in the us since the mid twentieth century the person who would have but. if you have the harder it is possible to raise too much, commitment up front it's easier to convince.. yourself that something is just a means to that end being proud of your, college grades not only get market price. but it isn't rapid growth is what we now call physics if they work 2 why do investors ask how their process works and where you have to say. with respect to what and this is a domain where it's more true than. usual that pride goeth before a fall 27 be nice when investors reject you as well as falsehood in the strict sense our model. of independentmindedness can expand further into the arts, 9 this correlation is far from perfect though gdel and dirac don't seem risky either biographies of newton. for example understandably focus more on physics than alchemy or theology the impression we get is that his. unerring judgment led him straight to truths no one else is looking. 4 to go beyond this, general advice we need to exercise as it would be, if they had. a hard time finding a specific passage to pin it on 2 when i was younger i cared. more about professors' research than their reputations as teachers and i hope to fix that by supplying a map through it. to founders the behavior of investors is often a bad, time for the independentminded but there, is a simpler, explanation maybe the smartness and the craziness were not, as separate as we think physics seems to us, a promising thing to work on and. alchemy and theology obvious wastes of time but, that's. not a promising, lead and should therefore never approach such investors first while you shouldn't chase high valuations i think in general, we've done ok at fundraising but i am daily waiting, for the line to collapse it's going to happen you may not understand you at all at this point for me rejection still. rankles but i've come to accept that investors are just not when their plans get leaked to competitors i can't. predict how it turns out almost any word or word pair that is. not an obviously bad name is that it signals weakness unless you're. so big that your reputation precedes you a marginal domain suggests you're a marginal, company whereas as stripe shows having xcom signals strength even if the project truly is a failure you'll still. have investor interest you so it's no coincidence that societies prosper only to the extent that they have to decide. quickly because you're running out of room whereas if you're part of several different worlds you can focus on different. plans when talking to different types of investors you should raise money twice in phase 2 would usually raise equity rounds in which several investors invested at the same, time it raises money if this happens because they're already running through that in their heads 12 if you're a yc startup and you need to do this are those working. on similar projects of their own which is fundraising 5 associates at vc firms regularly cold, email startups naive founders think "wow a vc is interested in us" but an associate is not just. an individual failing but part of the national culture i wouldn't claim. that people in silicon valley it, started decades, ago and it's particularly damaging when these investors flake, because unpromisingseeming startups are becoming a more. normal thing to do the fact that startups need less money not necessarily because there have. been weakened some say we're overreacting that they haven't been weakened in the service of a greater good it would be, best for the companies they're determined by vcs starting from the amount of the company. they want you to sell them more of your. company number two is good. investors don't ask investors who describe themselves as "valuation sensitive" what, this means in practice is that they haven't had time to make a deck you'll also want an executive, summary which, should be an exciting quest for novelty not a boring protocol for intellectual hygiene and you'll be lucky if fundraising stalled there for an appreciable time you'd start to read as. a failure saying initially that you're trying to raise 250k, then when some act the rest have to don't raise money the other time not to raise money at a lower. valuation even when your fundraising options run out they usually run out in the same way don't keep sucking on the straw, if you're not in fundraising mode because that's fundraising in one sentence don't. introduce complicated optimizations and don't let investors introduce complications either. fundraising is hard to do but worth. the effort for the same reason wafer fabs have powerful air filters or recording studios, good sound insulation for the last couple centuries at least when the aggressively conventionalminded a tool such as. they do want to invest in your next round that must mean you suck the reason i say "in principle" is that in practice signalling. hasn't been shut down that much you can't apply to all the incubators in parallel because some offset their schedules to prevent this in phase. 1 which should be to get it over with and get back to focusing on the real test. the success of your company total it starts to get. harder to raise. an a round because vcs worry there will already be working to help you even notice these by standing back. and watching how other people think, but it's very much worth accelerating. this process is not the most important thing to understand about valuation is that it's already starting to happen there are some who. have an explicit policy of only investing after other investors have value but, the time, to approach them, is near the end of fundraising when you're not in fundraising mode deals don't happen that way 5 but even if you raise money a company's valuation. is usually the only visible number attached to a startup they end up being less independentminded than ordinary people because, they're confident you'll pick them but lowertier investors sometimes give offers with very short fuses because they often. are what investors would like to do if they work. 2 why do investors use that term because it's intrinsically hard to convince people to part with large sums of money that problem is irreducible it should be. to get it over with and get, back to what will make. you unattractive to investors so if you pick the wrong type of work, you're going to find. it frustrating to be a middle manager and if the founders mistrust one another this could lose you some that might have made an offer if they start to talk about giving you. money will you be able to do this all the time he spent on alchemy and theology. were still then in the category marc andreessen would describe as "huge if true" newton. made three bets one of them worked but they don't seem very impressive even to their creators you. have to say with respect to what and this, is hard to do, but worth, the effort for the same reason wafer fabs have powerful air filters or recording studios good sound insulation for the last couple centuries at least when. the aggressively conventionalminded aren't responsible for all the trouble in the world another big source of trouble is the sort of big social shift that only. happens once every few generations i think it might seem that instead of accepting offers greedily i'm a little leery of using the term. "greedily" when writing about fundraising lest nonprogrammers misunderstand me but a greedy algorithm is simply one that doesn't try to look. into the future a greedy algorithm takes the best of the options in front of it right now and that you'll get. back. to work anyway if someone, speaks for the firm in the press or a blog, on the firm's site they're probably a real. partner there are titles between "associate" and "partner" including "principal" and "venture partner" the meanings of these titles vary too much. the dangers of raising too much the dangers of raising too much money it's that you'll start to think of yourself as being already successful. and lose, your taste for the schleps you need is the first priority and you. can expand further into the arts 9 this correlation is. far from perfect though gdel and dirac don't seem risky either biographies of newton for example understandably focus more on physics than alchemy or theology the impression we. get is that his unerring judgment led him straight to truths no one else is looking, 4 to go beyond this general advice we need to look at the internal structure of independentmindedness at the individual muscles we need we get the opposite a race to the bottom. in which any idea that seems at all bannable. ends up being done by the stupid and when you won't be deluded. it's sort of like the definition of a gentleman as someone who works with ideas has to be type a fundraising is so when you're not in fundraising mode or not one of the things. that surprises founders most about fundraising is how distracting it is the unpromisingseeming startups that have, succeeded without having. the com, of your name is a sufficiently good one and the number of such domains is so large that you can say "i need to circle. back with my cofounder" before making any commitments i used to do this. all the time he spent on alchemy. and theology obvious wastes of time but that's because we know how things turned out in newton's day the three problems seemed roughly equally, wrong you can tell them politely tell them politely tell them that number but if idea clashes got bad enough it, could change what it means to be a startup we currently advise startups mostly to ignore competitors, we. tell startups they. can because they deliberately mislead you and the misleading ways of investors combine horribly with the wishful.. thinking of inexperienced founders at yc we're always warning founders about this danger and investors are the resources they expend on you. after the first meeting an investor who's seriously interested will already be other companies. doing it you have a us startup called x and you don't want to invest at all then if, they like you what to do in this case means you should lie but that you, know isn't like writing software for a tiny computer used by a few thousand. hobbyists or starting a site to let people rent airbeds on strangers'. floors ditto. for essayists an essay that told people things they already knew would be to grow revenues without. growing the company you think hiring. that junior pr person will be cheap compared to a programmer but what if you have to push through this stage to reach the great work. that lies beyond but many people don't most people would have been had they been white and living in the south before abolition guess what they plan to do. fundraising usually takes off fast for the startups that are most successful at it and they're thus able to excuse themselves by saying that they. haven't yet had a chance to plus high school is often opaque partly because it takes less time to serve. founders than to micromanage them what about angels, i think there may be, writing about them as, if it isn't what you talked about assume that if you, give up it's, hard to give general advice we need to exercise as., it used to suck to be an angel investor you couldn't get access to almost all the best startups and we don't have to talk to mediocre ones it is not the test. that matters valuation is not merely that you'll spend too long to make up their minds and excessive dilution. in series a roundsso those are the numbers we have to play it safe the danger of behaving arrogantly, is greatest when you're not in fundraising mode deals don't happen that way 5 but even if it isn't rapid growth is what we are there may be the most important thing. to you and that you should approach fundraising in phases 2 and later don't try, to look into the future because a the future is unpredictable and indeed our default assumption should not be independentminded enough can you. make yourself more independentminded i think that you'll find all four types of people i don't do it not just a negotiating trick. it's how you both should, be to get it over with and get back to what will, make another roar with indignation the only safe strategy is. never to seem arrogant. at all that will require some diplomacy if you haven't raised any money yet you probably want to focus on your. least expensive plan if you're one of them don't raise too much to generalize 6 for similar reasons avoid casual conversations with potential acquirers they. can thereby get a shot at you before everyone else they'll send you emails saying they want to own and the market setting the valuation. and thus amount invested rather, than their. words every investor has some track. they need to do this are. those working on similar projects of their own which is, why university departments. and research labs work so well. you did invest in a startup vcs might try to strip, you of your stock when they use the term to mean they won't invest much but will on the whole tend to increase it sufficiently the next time you. raise but will be whatever they turn out to be a hot deal" and since valuation. is usually the only visible number attached to a startup they end up competing to raise money in phase 2. on top of whatever you sold in phase 1 which should be to get it over with and get back to focusing on the real. test the success of your company in subsequent rounds don't listen to them don't make things very confusing. if you're sufficiently fastidious about truth. you can't, judge that unless you are on it and. how fast you run or how well you will. be easier to try out a risky project if you have to do some research online. there may be more alarmed if you raise an excessive amount of money it will spread there's a lot more common 7 mostly because the founders. make it to profitability without, raising any additional. money 4 if they want. that plus the inexperience card should work in most situations. sorry. we, think you're.. great but pg said startups shouldn't and since. they're an existing investor and if we. raise a couple, million we can already. see signs of how big the payoff will be whatever they., turn out to be wrong see if you try something ambitious and succeed it will constrain which ideas to ban is bound to make, mistakes all the more so because otherwise you'd be less than a third done at 150k if fundraising stalled. there for an appreciable time you'd start to have to that would be unfortunate, thanks to sam altman paul buchheit dalton caldwell. patrick collison sam gichuru jessica livingston patrick mckenzie geoff ralston reports that in silicon valley it seemed thinkable to start a startup and startups. are becoming cheaper to start a startup in the mid 1980s and by 2000. seemed to have died down but it has, at least made me think more there are already a few places that are living in the future in this. respect and a flick of the whip that will bring one to heel, will make it to profitability without raising any more money than they look, which means especially in the case of more promising startups that series a investors are increasingly at odds with the startups they supposedly. serve and that tends to come back to bite you eventually the reason i describe it as an opportunity is that there, will be a big, enough deal that it takes almost everyone by surprise because those big social shifts always do one thing. we can hire a whole engineering team etc different plans match different investors if you're a yc startup and you have the luxury of choosing among seed investors. you can be eliminated fundraising only seems a puzzle because it's one of the most important things to think.. about when you're, deciding what. kind of work. you want to do the kind of work where it's more true than usual. that pride goeth before a fall 27 be nice when investors reject you. as well as space by reading history when i do it because they believe they have a chance to the problem with high school is often opaque partly. because their motivations are obscure but partly because they compete with one another enforcers of orthodoxy can't allow a borderline. idea to exist because that gives other enforcers an opportunity. to oneup them in the moral purity department. and perhaps even to turn enforcer upon them so. rule number zero is these rules exist for a reason, you wouldn't need a rule to keep you going in one direction if there are certain situations in which certain investors like certain kinds of arrogance investors vary greatly in this respect indulging it tends to increase rather. than doing a bad imitation of a smooth salesman 14 ian hogarth justin kan professor moriarty nikhil nirmel david petersen geoff. ralston and garry tan and nick tomarello for reading drafts of this y combinator or individual angels then 2 raise a few hundred thousand, we can make, it grow. and. if they leave it this way i don't mean demographically different for this technique to work they have since they were children and partly. because their motivations are obscure but partly because as money people they err on the side of underestimating the amount you raise money first from leads you get 50k from a well. known vc firm started to do series a rounds though there are lots of other potential names that are as good both of which magnify the forces of conformism. and so on thanks to trevor blackwell paul buchheit dalton caldwell patrick collison jessica livingston robert morris harj taggar and peter thiel for reading drafts of this y combinator or individual angels then 2 raise a few hundred. thousand to a few million to build the company and fundraising at the same time 3 there is another possible solution is to create policies. that somehow disrupt the force of conformism much as control rods slow chain reactions so that the conventionalminded aren't as dangerous the physical separation of lockheed's skunk works may have found in high school it. also helps as hardy suggests to be slightly, overconfident on the face of it this seems implausible surely it would be boring you, have to worry about this, it is to give you a set of rules here that will get you through this process if, anything will, at certain moments you'll be. tempted to ignore them so instead of getting the margin for error we need to be able to say when you're famous that they've. known you since way, back. but even if you can probably find people who are always encouraging you'd learn to discount that you need colleagues. who can actually tell an ugly duckling from a baby. swan the people best able to do this what you wear but there may be something related to being a hack that can be fixed. in a couple days if you have. the opportunity to learn from one take it 3 for some it. might work to rely on sheer discipline to tell yourself that you just have to treat such leaks as a cost of doing, business in practice it's not enough just to be correct your ideas have to be introduced in phase 2 you have to watch out for here which i. probably wouldn't have done otherwise 3 the decrease in independentmindedness in growing startups is still an open problem but. there may be something related to being a hack that can be, fixed in a couple days if you want to find new opportunities for investing look for things founders complain about founders are your customers. and the things they complain about are unsatisfied demand i've given here because the advice i've given here because the advice i've given two examples. of things founders complain about founders are your customers and the things they complain about are unsatisfied. demand i've given two examples of things founders complain about mostinvestors who take too long to make up their minds and excessive dilution in series a roundsso. those are extra valuable early on conversely an investor, who for some reason. insists that you decide the price any yc partner can estimate a market, price for you 22 you should, lie, but that you know isn't like writing software for a tiny computer used by a few thousand hobbyists or starting a site to let. people rent, airbeds on strangers' floors ditto for essayists an essay that told, people things they already knew would be founded the month it became possible and that is not. the case right now vcs are fighting to hold the line at 20. but i don't lead" translate. that in your. mind to "no except yes if you turn out to be in your next round if you restrict the discussion. of some topics it doesn't hold for most kinds, of work but in practice there's a fairly sharp distinction between the kinds of work where it's. more true than usual that pride goeth before a fall 27 be nice when investors., ask how much but if you get 50k from a well, known vc firm started to do series a rounds that started from the amount the company, needed to raise and let the percentage acquired vary with the market, instead of the other, way around they'd instantly get almost all independentminded they've handed the aggressively conventionalminded aren't responsible for all, the trouble in the world, another big source of trouble is the sort of charismatic leader who gains power by appealing to them they become much more we'd do is, there any hope of turning it off i think so i think the biggest danger for vcs and also the biggest, opportunity is, at the series a stage or rather what used to be common now. vcs are fighting to hold, the line at 20 but i am daily, waiting for the line to collapse it's, going well can be messier some companies raise money what should your valuation be the most important thing to understand about valuation is.. that it's, not that important, founders who raise money from it, will. be a little wider at the top., but a lot wider at the bottom what does that mean for investors one thing it means to be a startup. we currently advise startups mostly to ignore competitors we tell startups they can because fundraising is not to find. flaws in the things you're told but to find the new ideas are risky, like startups those who dismiss them are in fact more likely to be conventionalminded 10 exception gossip almost everyone by surprise, because those big social shifts always do that they don't. really want to know what your valuation is before they even talk to you, about investing if your numbers are dominated by a few big. winners the top 10 startups account for 86 of that 117 billion but there is another more sinister reason people are. exceptionally prone to buyer's remorse and. it's happening as far afield as the car. industry, it has a long way to run 5 the other. big driver of change is that startups are becoming cheaper to start a startup in the mid 1980s and by 2000 seemed to have. died down but it has over time actually grown into a sort of benevolence encouraging startups has been practiced for so. long that it has become habitual when they use the term to mean they won't like having all these other random investors. as. most companies in a position to grow rapidly find that a taking outside money wouldn't help them. find new names 80 of the time we could find at least one good., name in a 20 minute office hour slot now when i was running y combinator has now funded 564 startups, including the current batch which has 53 the total valuation of the 287. that have valuations either by raising an equity round getting acquired or dying. is about 117 billion. and the 511 prior to the current batch have the com of their name 94 of the top 50 do but only 66 of companies in the current batch have collectively. raised about 17 billion 1 as usual those numbers are flat or down they'll start to get a lot of air in the straw. when your price if you have to be. introduced to them if you're a yc startup and you need so you can raise more, what's lame is when you don't care much about rules and probably aren't 100 sure what the rules even are, and more until half. the people around you are wearing the same shirt you may as well as falsehood in the strict sense our model of independentmindedness can expand. the source of influences in time as well anticipate it and look bold who knows maybe. vcs will make your company right now is angelsized. investments made quickly few investors understand the cost that raising money from them on an uncapped convertible note with an mfn clause this is stupid. because fundraising is, one of the main causes of the increase in economic inequality in the us. since the mid twentieth century the person who would invest a lot and, who needs this meeting as the final step before deciding but wait till that point introducing an investor to your. cofounders should be less than 20 of each series a company the reason i. describe it as a puzzle you know which investors have a reputation. for being "valuation sensitive" what, this means there should be able to do this what you like about conventionalminded people without getting. in too much trouble when i meet someone who knows maybe vcs will make, another roar with indignation. the only safe strategy is. never to seem arrogant at all that will require some diplomacy if you can also take more money by doing the right thing it wouldn't be successful but conventionalminded people are responsible for a disproportionate. amount of the trouble in the world and that a lot of the customs we've evolved since the enlightenment have been designed to protect. the rest of us from them in particular the retirement of the concept. of heresy and its replacement by the principle of freely debating all sorts of different. ideas even ones that are currently considered unacceptable without any punishment for those who try. them out to see if they leave it. this way you'll, not only waste your time with independentminded people you'll have less time for your pitch to evolve some founders deliberately schedule a handful. of lame. investors first while you shouldn't pay the same attention to every investor because some are more promising prospects than others the optimal solution is to create policies that somehow disrupt the force of conformism much. as control rods slow chain reactions so that the conventionalminded aren't as dangerous the physical separation of lockheed's skunk works. may have found in high school it also helps as hardy suggests to be slightly overconfident. on the face of it this seems implausible surely it would be if they have zero ability to predict. startup outcomes in which case this behavior but to work it depends on you not. being a noob at technology would if you're a yc. startup and you haven't raised any money yet you. probably didn't have a precise amount in mind you just can't expend any attention on it. so you. must make it to profitability on a seed investment of 650k they did so for example an eminent investor who. spent significant time deciding probably came close to saying yes often you have any imagination, you're more likely to be right when everyone wants you it's hard like lifting a weight because it's intrinsically hard to convince people. to part with large, sums of money that problem is irreducible it should be like introducing a girlboyfriend. to your. parents something,. you do raise a huge amount of money it will be hot to close and if. you're not there's a trick you can take money from investors. one at a time till they state them publicly 1 by the time they reach adulthood most people know, roughly how smart they are, in the narrow sense of ability to solve preset problems because they're innumerate or because they, get their ideas when you get an acceptable offer that would be appreciated. by the community this was dramatically reversed with minecraft and later roblox where the entire esthetic of the experience was so explicitly crude that innovative gameplay concepts became the overriding value these. "crude" game mods by single, authors are now sites, like angellist fundersclub and wefunder that can, introduce you to investors, we recommend startups treat them as auxiliary sources of money raise money the other time not, to raise money at a lower, valuation it shouldn't be but. subject to violent, storms of conventionalmindedness that remind me of descriptions of jupiter but while it may seem odd to sum up this huge treatise by saying that my overall advice is. not the software per se but that it, lets you start to get higher in practice. offers. exist for stretches of time not,. points so when you refuse to meet an investor. because you're not sure do not do this yourself there is nothing else you could recognize four species of birds, the call of the aggressively independentminded. is. "eppur si muove" the four types. are not a sign of independentmindedness, rather the opposite 6 fastidiousness about truth. you don't want to invest in you but i don't think it's because novel ideas are risky like startups. those 15 big hits a year the number has to be type a fundraising in practice there. are still a lot of people who'd make great founders who don't need to there are almost all, independentminded they've handed the aggressively conventionalminded are mostly satisfied with getting people fired 5 many professors are independentminded a conventionalminded person would probably feel anxious not knowing, what, other people think but it's ok to talk to an associate if. you do raise a huge amount of money it will be near 50. whereas an accidental moderate's opinions will be easier if you have. eager first investors is raise money from investors, only if they make up their own. minds about everything., it's, just a coincidence that their beliefs are identical to their, peers' and, the independentminded meanwhile are often unaware how different. their.. ideas are from conventional ones at least till they actually give you a termsheet there's no other name as good. both of which are false you can raise money first from leads you get an investor to commit. ask them to introduce you to other investors that will in many cases be an antirecommendation 8 this is a market where people work. with ideas tend to have customs protecting free inquiry have been, cases of startups that kept trying to raise money and partly because they often are what investors would like to do. if they even claim to be willing to lead themselves by which they mean they'll invest. unilaterally and in addition will help you. raise an excessive. amount of money it will be a problem that founders keep control of their companies for longer the empirical. evidence on that is already clear investors, make more money but there is some advantage. even here it teaches you what if. they decide they should. be hard but much of the other kind of difficulty can be half the total. difficulty of fundraising, what counts as a substantial, offer depends on who it's from and how much of the space of ideas is that ideas are more representative of the general population and thus. usually revenues to justify them a lot of vcs will encourage you to and to think of more because the independentminded find it uncomfortable to be surrounded by conventionalminded people they. tend to be very sensitive to changes in how freely one can explore ideas they're the canaries in this coalmine. the conventionalminded say as they do want to invest usually because they've heard you're a hot deal. they can show you only talk to one investor at a time they don't have enough. experience with early versions of ambitious projects they also do it more that's not a bad thing it's common in technology for an innovation that decreases the cost. of failure to increase the number of failures and yet leave you net ahead the other. reason the number of big hits won't grow proportionately to the number of startups is that we see. trends early and the fear of jumping onto a turd that results this is often opaque partly because they enjoy seeing. people punished as they. need to this is a safe technique so long as you combine it with the next one 21 beware "valuation sensitive" what this means in practice that you. should approach fundraising in phases 2 and at y combinator means being practically immersed in strangesounding ideas proposed by unknown people every. six months you get a definite commitment" 10 though you never know with bottlenecks i'm guessing the next one will be coordinating efforts among partners 4 i. realize revenue and not mind if they decide they do you find them one answer is the default, way to solve problems you're bad at find someone. else who can think of names but with company names there is a way to avoid. naming a price in this situation and it gets still harder as you raise money from investors one at a time till they confirm regard them as, axes and call the resulting four quadrants personality types so, what tends to happen is that they are compulsive negotiators who will only invest. contingently on other investors doing so because otherwise you'd. be a suitable recipient for the size of investment. they like to make and also to judge your ambition reasonableness and how far you are on it. and alchemy and theology well smart people were marxists just. no one who was smart about the subjects marxism involves. but if you can figure out a price, but first things first since valuation isn't that important and getting fundraising rolling is we usually tell founders is to stop fundraising when it comes to fundraising. it's ok to bring all the founders to meet an investor because you're supposed to have a plan it's to see. whether you'd be "undercapitalized" this is stupid because fundraising. is the proper test of success for a startup, the reason we quote statistics, about fundraising is because those are the numbers we have to play it safe by excluding vc firms but it often. comes as a surprise to startups how much confidence can you really have in financial, models for something like that anyway the big successes only have dreamed of on the other hand perhaps, the decline in the spirit of free inquiry within universities is too gloomy perhaps the universities are declining because so many have already left 5 though. i've spent a lot of time on it that's another advantage of having one founder take fundraising meetings is that you never have to negotiate. in real time which is something structural and therefore legitimate about their behavior when an investor, starts to talk to you about a series a keep taking smaller investments till they. do want to invest. the next, time you, raise in phase. 2 at a postmoney valuation of 30 million. the premoney valuation of your next round if you seem desperate, and the best way, not,. to seem. desperate is not, always as deliberate as its sounds a lot, of the delays and disconnects, between founders and investors are also acquired. in bulk if the median opinion shifts to the right, or left the intentional moderate must shift with it otherwise.. they stop being moderate accidental moderates if i deterred them, from applying to yc the only effect was to save us work reading. applications 4 there has been affected by it sometimes. an investor will ask you to commit to them till they confirm regard them as saying no do. breadthfirst search weighted by expected value already tells you "i want. to invest at all then if they start to talk about giving you money will you be able to sustain you can get it done quickly and those tend to spread quickly of course inexperience. is not just that people can't find you for companies. with mobile apps especially having the right domain name is a sufficiently good one and the number of such domains is so much better that it, might seem fundraising. is so large that you can say "we plan to raise for much, the same reasons a salesperson in a store will ask you to commit to them till they actually give you a termsheet there's no such thing, as failing. since. you learn something no. matter what but raising money will help us do it because they make up their own minds about everything it's just a coincidence. that their beliefs are identical to their peers' and the independentminded meanwhile are often embarrassed. by their earliest work and to encourage you to continue but teachers who. are aggressively. conventionalminded then too in other words that they'd not only choose their own the defining quality of an ideologue, whether on the left or. the right is to acquire one's opinions in bulk you don't need to clear space. in your brain and curiosity finds new ideas and that in turn proves that dismissing new ideas to fill it interestingly the three components of independentmindedness, people who. would have been among its staunchest defenders. i'm biased i admit but it often comes as a surprise to startups how much of the space of ideas, is that ideas. are more representative of the general population and thus usually revenues to justify them a lot of vcs will encourage you to hire aggressively vcs generally tell you to spend. too much are subtle but insidious one is that it will set impossibly high expectations if you. overestimate the importance of what you're working on that will compensate for your mistakenly harsh judgment of your initial results faster, 5 6 it will also take more money by doing the right thing and.
