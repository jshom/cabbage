%HESITATION I'm wildlife veterinarian Dr Michelle Kneeland and this is the wildlife health connections podcast we're taking you deep into every corner of wild life health and conservation let's go he mo pericytes as the name implies we're talking about blood pericytes no not blood sucking parasites but tiny microscopic parasites that actually live in the bloodstream or even inside red blood cells there are many different types of humor pericytes but probably the most famous or infamous him a pair site is malaria malaria is a disease caused by human pericytes of the genus Plasmodium the ancient Romans believe the disease will spread to the err so they named it malaria which basically translates to bad err but now we know malaria is not spread through airborne transmission but it's actually spread through mosquitoes and a few other blood sucking insects malaria is one of the most severe public health problems worldwide it's a leading cause of death and disease in many developing countries in tropical and subtropical regions but what you may not know is that malaria is also found in many species of wildlife including birds reptiles and mammals the Plasmodium genus is incredibly diverse and each type of wildlife tax they have their very own species of Plasmodium which are different than the Plasmodium species that cause human ellaria unless we're talking bout primates but more on that later and the crazy thing is we're just starting to scratch the surface of this problem and wildlife and the more places we look the more species we sample the morning speeches of malaria pericytes we're discovering and we're not just finding in tropical regions for example even malaria has been found across the globe basically everywhere except Antarctica it's all fascinating but also frankly overwhelming to think about and to study these microscopic bloodborne malarial parasites and wildlife you need to be someone who's equal parts rugged field biologist parasitologist and Lackner geneticist thankfully I happen to know one of these rare unicorns of wildlife health research and her name is doctor Ellen Martin's in doctor Martins and earned her PhD in biology from the university of Vermont and conducted her postdoctoral research at the Smithsonian conservation biology institutes center for conservation genomics through the integration of field microscopy and genetic methods she aims to better understand the complex associations between the malarial pericytes they're well they posts and Miskito vectors the cool of her work is a holistic understanding of malarial Persei transmission in the context of a rapidly changing world she's currently based out of Vermont where she lives with her husband to children a pack of dogs in a flock of chickens so here she is her win of humor pericytes the maven of malaria the one and only doctor Ellen Martin in my early twenties I worked on a conservation based project in Hawaii and I was doing stamp work with an endangered species there this group %HESITATION endemic bird species the honeycreeper is that intellect in isolation from pathogens for a long long long time so then we brought over the mosquito we bought over into dispersed but she's carrying Plasmodium parasite and okay I just jumped into the native endemic Hawaiian honeycreeper is and %HESITATION has resulted in the endangerment and extinction the majority of those and then a comic stripper species the only eighteen of the fifty six and then a call at one eight hundred paper species still exist %HESITATION and then one of the main factors in causing their species the population to client extension so that's started my interest and when I press nine and then as a graduate student at the university of Vermont I I hooked up with a bird bander who was who is doing fieldwork with with berries in setting up miss nothing catching birds and taking blood samples and I set up a mismanagement the bird feeder in my backyard and I cotton chickadees in cardinals in my case and when Packers and I took just %HESITATION a drop of blood and and and made it a den microscopes mer and looked and looked at the smears under the light microscope and I finally I passed I need for is in my backyard so that thanks bye my interest and %HESITATION got me hooked on setting like okay thanks in part well I love that you did that your backyard that's awesome yeah yeah it all happened and when I when I talk to people about that project I found that over forty percent of birds in Vermont harbor infection by land per se so I tell people when you look out your window and you see present your bird feeder there's a good chance that one or more of those verses affected the lack I say great every time I watch the birds on my feet %HESITATION I'm just going to be worrying about all of them and thinking about human pericytes but Ellen brings up a good point which is that we can't know the true prevalence or get a better understanding of him up here saying fictions and wildlife if we're not actually looking for them yeah I like to tell I like to tell people that taking taking a blood sample from invertebrate hosts whether it be a checking D. or a squirrel or a deer when you look at the animal on the outside you see it's kind of like looking at a Buck but when you take a blood sample from an animal in your email to examine for different health measures whether it be white blood cell counts are account or look at different packaging whether it be malaria parasites or other things like try panels on these are bacteria viruses kind of like opening the book and well we've been talking mostly about avian malaria so far these Plasmodium him a pericytes are just an avian problem what most folks don't know about malaria is that thank genus Plasmodium is amazingly diverse and widespread and common so if we look at other host tax not just human but other great ape species we see that they have their own password in species and then if we look at other primate center road in fat lizards birds and mammals we see they all have their own type money in pay thanks as well and if we count the number of Plasmodium species in all these bird about groups worldwide to that there's thousands and thousands of species the password in Pere side and they're on every continent except Antarctica so there perhaps one of the most successful diverse and widespread Perris eight groups of vertebrate animals worldwide okay so there's all these different types of Plasmodium that cause malaria and all these different wildlife species is there any risk of doing %HESITATION says like is there any risk that malaria could be transmitted from an animal to a person or even the other way around so we know in South America that we've brought malaria parasites over next jump into native hi Nate this is there and we know in Africa that that president species I talked about before prize money invested from that's responsible for over ninety eight percent %HESITATION Leri apparent malaria infections in humans that species is the result of a host what she found can go L. S. and that probably explains why that let me see the promotion very late and that that's a when people think of %HESITATION mortality from Leri it's to depart that species Plasmodium passed that branch and we also know from studying and Southeast Asia that we have the whole switching of Leri press aides from macaques entertainment so there is the whole switching from %HESITATION from closely related primate species entertainment as well as the host wishing from him and entertainment J. quick aside here because now this begs the question how the hell do we know all this how do you actually detect Tina pericytes and human or animal well since he's pericytes live in the blood you need a blood sample and they're basically two ways to screen for him %HESITATION pericytes and a blood sample the first method is the good old fashioned let's near and microscopy putting a drop of blood %HESITATION microscope slide it's merry get out into a thin films you can look at individual blood cells and then looking at it under the microscope and you're just trying to visually identify these parasites on the slide this might sound easy but it's not and I can say from experience with my own failed attempts at these little jerks can be really hard to find and identify and to make things even more annoyingly complicated the malaria parasite goes through multiple developmental life stages well in the blood in each stage looks different for example depending on the late stage in the speeches of the malaria they can look ring shaped around an initiate or even I'm me void which just means they basically look like in a more office club great that's super helpful and even if you are an expert like an Ellen Martin's in level him up here say again the fire there's still the chance that you're going to miss someone a blood smear simply because they're not there sometimes the infection level is so low and there are so few parasites in the blood there might not be any on the flyer that you're looking at or the pericytes might have left the circulating blood all together and gone to hide out in the organs of the body but more on that in a minute so obviously just depending on microscopy and blood smears is not ideal what other options do we have well now we have molecular methods such as P. C. R. we're we can detect the pericytes DNA in a blood sample and these methods are way more sensitive and give us way more information and this is what prompted Ellen to take the plunge into using these genetic methods for her own research I was actually at a third meeting and I was on the elevator with somebody that I intend to be able to work with a mentor and I and I told my problem but I know I'll setting where precise but I'm kind of I I had caution about doing lab work because up until then I had only done field biology and worked on a number of bird projects across the country and I'm getting my hands dirty and catching birds the gnats and spending how they where they where they Nast and how many babies are born and all that stuff but I remember that I number that elevator ride and she said email Allen if you are able to open a cookbook and follow a recipe you'll be able to do that you need for this project so I went home from that bird beating thanking I can do that the way that they learned all the lab nothin I didn't think I would be one to enjoy being in the lab and actually actually love being in the lab so these newer molecular methods have really opened her eyes and giving us a whole new perspective on just how many species of malarial parasites are out there based on different studies for example just in North America there's over two hundred species a password in in burnt and then globally and we know that time is over five hundred different species of pods money number so the more people study the last numbers using like the more diversity we're finding it's pretty amazing and %HESITATION it's almost an exponential growth and number of password in the spaces that we discovered based on the number of of host species sample okay so now we're transitioning into the part of the episode where things start to get really crazy talking about host parasite sector interactions remember these malarial pericytes can't spread directly from animal to animal they didn't insect vector usually Miskito to complete their life cycle and transmit from one host to another I think I'm just going to leave it there and not go into all the gritty details of the life cycle of malaria %HESITATION Triffids %HESITATION ways to shy's ons to get me to sites cetera but if you want to satisfy your curiosity and also potentially give yourself a migraine go ahead and Google Plasmodium lifecycle and check out those flow charts made by the CDC go head rejoin us once he recovered so so far we've just been talking at the parasites and the vertebrate hosts but we haven't talked about the invertebrate house so then Miskito is the doctor hosted with possible for transmitting a passing parasite between vertebrate hello so we there is dozens and dozens of Miskito Baxter species that transmit malaria parasite interesting if you follow infection in the course of inspection and individual animal say issue man or a bird you can see that there is an acute phase where the parasite numbers in number to host a pretty high that's usually when the first acquire you inspection so your first then by an infected mosquito and your immune system is trying to to battle in action and and perfect numbers are high if you sample %HESITATION during that time in a complex there there's a good chance that you'll see the parasites in the blood L. but after that initial acute there is an infection the body either completely eliminate the infection and so you don't have the implant infection anymore or most often it brings it down to a level and where you have this late and stays in the construction with a price I've kinda just dormant in the tissue whether it be the lead fire with the kidney and during that period of time doing that lately inspection time if you sample the vertebrate host and make a blood smear you're not going to see the parasites in the blood cells there's certain times of infection we can you you're very unlikely to be the past by any correspondence to the winter so bridges they have a life long way press I. inspections %HESITATION but it makes sense for the person at the hideout and go dormant in the tissue during the winter because we don't have the fighting back tears out thank you your ability to go from host to host is pretty now okay just to recap because that's kind of really cool and actually makes a lot of sense if the goal of these pericytes is to eventually get picked up by another mosquito so they can complete their life cycle and go on to infect more hosts then they don't want to be floating around needlessly in the bloodstream because this is where they could get recognized and destroyed by the host immune system so they don't want to be there unless there's an opportunity for them to actually be ingested by Miskito so instead their strategies they kind of go into witness protection and hide out inside the organs and tissues where they can more easily evade the immune system and they hide out there into the mosquitoes are buzzing around again let us get a part is really exciting after doing field work with burns you know that it's really difficult to get permission to get an apartment you they get state permit you have to get landings permanency got %HESITATION maintain your nest net and it you gotta wake up at the crack of dawn complains that three A. M. get your sales by five four and to get your son out before the sun comes up so it's actually a really difficult way to sample for pericytes but I was doing my post doctoral work act and national sales I mean implication and I started doing that after work which is amazing because you don't have to make up early you don't have to set up business that they don't need to handle that %HESITATION %HESITATION thank you just hang up traps and I used two different tracks to sample mosquitoes I used to live taps which is just a simple trap with the light and the fan and one nine whiskey does fly and they're blown down into look a Cup and then you go out and you you collect your cops and knew you freeze nearer specimens and then you start time under the dissection scope and identify them to species and from there in the lab I would take individual details and only the female so it's only the female with details and take like mail %HESITATION I would sort them by species and identify them based on morphological characters and then I went out the salivary glands and H. Miskito thing you gently T. as a part of the head from the thorax of the mosquito and then I would take the salivary glands and put it in a tube and then do the DNA extraction and PCR screening and I talked about previously defined in section okay so that all sounds pretty crazy to me I'm trying to imagine you under a microscope actually dissecting salivary glands away from the Miskito and I would imagine that that's not the easiest thing to do and it definitely not the easiest thing to do but it's it's fine I would I am partial to the microscope as I as the probably no %HESITATION so and working with miss Kato's actually opened my eyes to the winners and the insect Rowling I mean I have respect anticipation for for in Texas but I got to really appreciate and we should look at them under and I sections competed pretty amazing little little creatures and just recently within the last ten years people have been sampling the scales for malaria parasite and they've been finding lately our perfect they haven't yet sampled from vertebrate hello so sampling the mosquito laughter is actually proving to be fruitful in discovery of pathogens that we haven't yet samples from writer but %HESITATION this makes sense because we know that certain vertebrate groups for example if we just look at burns you know certain bird groups are difficult to catch so most people are setting up miss nothing catching pastor Rangers songbirds %HESITATION but there's a diversity of birds out there that you can't catch and missed not like herring thank rat owl %HESITATION thank you and as of those groups so sampling the doctors is actually a great way to get a %HESITATION a better picture of the diversity of America state to cleaning and a host immunity and of course when we talk about the C. does we have to talk about climate change yeah so we I was involved in a study with %HESITATION asking if this is the New Jersey that I just recently shown up in New Jersey in the nineteen sixties the traditional distribution in South America and the southeastern U. S. and this is Kato station and now that is now further expanding northward I just two years ago was documented for the first time in southern Ontario so this and we know this message transmitted the burns as well as other pathogens including human pathogens like west Nile virus and triple H. so we know that there's a number of mosquito species worldwide expanding our means more sprinted to climate change and we know that they're bringing their pathogens with them so on the topic of mosquitoes this is where we segue into a really interesting story of how Ellen accidentally rediscovered malaria in white tail deer and to tell the story we need to go back to the year nineteen sixty seven there was a study by the U. S. T. A. N. S. sixty is in Texas and they were taking wild white tailed deer into captivity and they were still active facing the deer so basically these researchers were surgically removing this cleans of these dear but they were studying some little invasive so why were they doing this the spleen helps filter the blood and supports the immune system so if you remove it it makes it easier to detect any inspections or pathogens that you're trying to study which is exactly what happened here and in one of those gear and a single blood smear taking that day ten post splenectomy they found some blood pressure and never been seen before and so they they texted that slide away and that one slide from that one year with the mystery pericytes and it's blood to stay tucked away in a shelf for years until they showed it to someone who actually knew what they were looking at the main researcher shared it with the world treating malaria parasite researcher %HESITATION Casey C. Garnham and kind of look at that place near and said wow these are malaria parasite and he described the species America from the white tail deer and that was published in nineteen eighty and that was a big surprise because up until then we did not know of any endemic malaria parasite and mammals in the New World we knew that there are lots and lots of different has put a species in Old World Manal but as for New World mammals or no international so that discovery of that that mosquito species in the wait time there was a big surprise and %HESITATION many thought it was a hoax it wasn't meal an action that people look in white tail deer from my check but merry thousands and thousands of listeners across the country and they couldn't find the Peris H. again so because only that one researcher PCC Garnham saw those malarial pericytes only on that one slide from that one's clean the steer and no one else was able to find them again after that a lot of people kind of just write it off as fake news but now fast forward several decades to the year twenty sixteen and that's were Ellen enters the story %HESITATION but it wasn't until like a lan methods came around that we we discovered that has what information is private prizewinning oracle yeah I and I actually %HESITATION accidentally discovered it I at the printing press the infection from the Miskito I sampled in Washington DC and fortunately that Mezquita %HESITATION hi this had a really strange Leri perfect sequence it definitely wasn't bird malaria and a group with the Mammillaria parasite but it wasn't closely related to any of them and this was by looking at %HESITATION gene sequences doing like their work and so fortunately that Miskito that isolated that strange sequence from she was black so she had an invoice adamantine able to sequence the vertebrate Denain her abdomen and find out the change that upon my guilty or so I accidentally we discovered pike medium identically I and I know I did because I actually borrowed that single smear from that the nexus size beer in Texas from the national hatching them and London so that same single blood slide from that one deer in Texas in nineteen sixty seven was still kicking around in a museum and she was able to get our hands on it to confirm that it was this new malarial species she had found in the mosquito pretty cool and then I was able to get one here is from the %HESITATION from Virginia and screen print from where percent inspection using likely methods and I found that they were in fact then I looked at the bloody merrier and I was able to see the pericytes but it took me hours and hours of scanning mir's from most white tail deer defined the terrified with section was so low transaction level in the deer and I found one infected by blood cell pursue sixty five thousand %HESITATION so if you're going to discover these things by light microscopy you have to spend a lot of time and look at multiple smears from a single animal and so molecular methods there's %HESITATION way more accurate and and and finding infections and then also understanding what species they are and so since then we re discovered a number of Plasmodium species and worldwide including different species in Africa and Asia and another question I had is %HESITATION he will pericytes increasing or are we just getting better at detecting them is the prevalence of merry press eight going up in these in these species it's gonna take studies over a long period of time to answer that question and there's been some ongoing studies in bird %HESITATION and obviously in human and that show that in certain areas in certain regions of Leri press the infection is going up over time and with respect to prohibit host at more northern latitudes we know that some of them are showing signs of infection or showing where percent inflation for the first time for example with the common loon Sentelle and brought up common loons frantic a brief detour here because I wanted to talk to you a list a new house Alyssa is one of Ellen's grad students at the university of Vermont and she's just starting her master's degree studying malaria in common loons so I'm just going to start off by saying that I'm pretty jealous of you that you get to work with Ellen as one of your graduate advisors at university of Vermont and %HESITATION I'm just curious what what is it like working with her and be honest now keep in mind we can always edit this out if we need to but what what's it like we're working with Alan yeah no Allen is there %HESITATION she's an amazing %HESITATION adviser and I really I came to it like I came looking for an adviser and not knowing that I wanted to do research with birds or malaria parasite and it's kind of debating between two different advisors and %HESITATION Ellen actually got me just super excited about her own project because she's so passionate about it and the first time that she told me about malaria parasites in deer and birds she was just so excited to share all the information and yeah she really open up the door to this realm that I'm now in yeah I love having her as an advisor she's great good job that was a test still like I tell her if he's anything so I'm going to be looking at %HESITATION kind of the distribution and the prevalence of malaria parasite across the entire southern edge %HESITATION the common then breeding range so it kind of span from like Washington all over to %HESITATION New Hampshire and Maine and Massachusetts and I also just have a I have a ton of data and it's it's been about ten years so I kind can kind of follow how malaria parasites are moving over time and how maybe they're moving west or east or north so I'm mainly working with data that's already been collected Allen and I are kind of collaborating with a bunch of different organizations throughout the country so we actually haven't done any of the field work for the blood samples that we've got and we've all %HESITATION we just kind of receive them through the mail basically %HESITATION just because fieldwork with wins capturing in banding and taking what is really really difficult process and %HESITATION yeah we're kind of leaving that to %HESITATION the organizations that are dedicated to doing that you got it like midnight when it's dark and you shine light on the water and I think if you see a lan you basically scooped up within that yeah I I I feel like we could do an entire episode just talking about what goes on with with actually capturing that lead from the wild K. slate tension here but I had to ask her about this I find her linkedin profile that a couple of years ago she actually worked in the medical examiner's office not studying wildlife but studying good people and %HESITATION a person was shot away and then they kind of let us get our hands dirty I guess that I'll talk to you well so you were you were actually in there assisting with these human yeah yeah is there isn't a very interesting experience I couldn't tell you exactly why I got into it but %HESITATION I am glad I did it and I'm not really I'm not squeamish I have watched a couple of we need copies this past summer and %HESITATION fine I think it's cool now it does relate to what I'm doing now just a little bit different and finally I awkwardly ask Alyssa if she can help me get better at identifying human pericytes under the microscope just curious if I could be an intern with you for a while okay I've only looked for pericytes a couple times and I was actually using one of those %HESITATION Justin tool microscope and I was with Alan and so I was sitting there looking at the side and she would scan and she would just pause whenever she thought anything that kind of %HESITATION stood out Ellen is definitely an expert on it %HESITATION but one thing that is really cool when you're scanning for them %HESITATION if you see something shiny %HESITATION that's usually indicative that there is a malaria parasite because the malaria parasite %HESITATION they %HESITATION that like hemoglobin he ro well then you know go in in your blood is toxic to them so they actually %HESITATION they like bundle it up and it turns into the shiny metal looking things if you see something like that under the microscope %HESITATION you can be pretty sure that you're looking at a malaria parasite oh wow okay yeah I didn't know yeah we talk to Eleanor about that I've only seen it maybe two or three times in the %HESITATION five but we scanned but it is really cool but also very difficult you have pro tip there I love it yeah I know and I think getting blood smears on a slide is just an art and Illinois so that you can tell if that that student today or biologist and that because of that students are usually very nice and then and pretty and in a biologist to kind of go out so no fences biologists out there no I and yeah now let's jump back and wrap things up with Ellen and while I had hoped to end this interview by asking Alan something really insightful or intelligent instead I went completely off the rails and ended up asking her a really dumb question which was so you spend a lot of time spending birds have you ever caught a human in your missed that that would be really funny to catch a human I've I've had people %HESITATION nine minus not usually it's a birders it's people who are L. at the crack of dawn is usually burgers %HESITATION order standing by looking at Virginia and my most and %HESITATION but I've never actually caught I caught him in a really funny yeah unfortunately I don't think we have the permits to actually sample human being so I would have to be just a catch and release in my defense a few years ago some biologists told me a story about how one day some kind of mountain bike ignore the trail closings and came riding town right where they were setting up their back mist nets and the guy ended up just barely right internet and getting all caught and it is used buckle so yes it's a thing that can happen before we sign off here is there anything or should say if you could leave our listeners with with one quote OR one important idea if they remember nothing else from the podcast today what would that be what would you what listeners to remember I guess I would want folks to remember just to get out in nature lots of time managing the more time you're out there the more things you'll notice the more things your own server and also the more things you'll find so when you are when you go out and get turning over stone as you're likely to make some discoveries it's pretty pretty amazing %HESITATION A. P. R. I. as there are into to saying anything thanks for listening to another episode of the wildlife health connections podcast if you liked what you heard go hit that subscribe button and leave this review you can check us out on social media for some good content and advance notice about coming up so you can also get more information %HESITATION wildlife health dot O. R. G. slash podcast 

I'm wildlife veterinarian Dr Michelle Kneeland and this is the wildlife health connections podcast we're taking you deep into every corner of wild life health and conservation let's go hello friends and welcome to the first episode of the wildlife health connections podcast when I got the idea to start this podcast and I started planning things out there were a lot of things I didn't know in details I hadn't figured out yet but the one thing I did know right from the start with who I wanted to have as my first guest this amazing person I'm talking about is doctor mark progress if you're involved in the world of wildlife health there's a good chance you already know his name yeah he's kind of a big deal but he's also one of the most humble people on the planet who never took his own horn so I'll do it for him mark is a wildlife veterinarian with five decades of experience working on everything from pathology eco toxicology clinical while like medicines do medicine research teaching and too many other things to list he's currently associate professor emeritus at tufts coming school of veterinary medicine or he's been a faculty member since nineteen eighty eight he was also the director of the tufts wireless clinic from nineteen ninety five to two thousand and eight and in addition to all of that mark is one of the people who first introduced the term conservation medicine and initially developed that whole field he then went on to help found the tufts center for conservation medicine if you haven't heard the term before conservation medicine is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on health relationships between humans animals and the environment the goal of conservation medicine is to sustain a biodiversity and protect ecosystems for improved health of wildlife domestic animals and people as well and even though it has the word medicine in the title this isn't just a field for vets and human doctors and also involved in many different professions across the realms of biology ecology environmental sciences social sciences economics and many others this field is becoming an increasingly important part of Wiley's house and today they are conservation medicine programs at many universities and institutions around the world if this piece your interest and you want to learn more I think we did some links in the show notes marks technically supposed to be retired right now but I don't see any evidence of that type from a slightly greater beard he actually seems busier than ever these days collaborating on a bunch of projects organizing working groups helping students getting talks and he's even writing a book the last time I saw mark in person we met up in a capellas parking lot in Maine so I could borrow because I'll talk to you saw and talk about wintry kids which sounds like a totally normal sentence if you've ever been lucky enough to work with mark before he's also the reason why I currently have a bag full of frozen severed bird lakes in my freezer next to the frozen pizza don't worry this came from birds that were already did we only just scratched the surface in our interview today and there are so many more other things but I want to talk to mark about he's definitely going to be a frequent flyer here on the podcast so this episode leaves you wanting more mark don't worry he'll be back soon in this episode we learn about marks Creasy path to becoming the wild effect that he's today from living in Venezuela dissecting into condos do you think bird surgeries on his dining room table and then starting at school just a year after losing his leg to cancer he's an inspiration an example of the type of set in person I strive to be and he's just one of my favorite humans on the planet I'm so excited for you guys to meet him so here he is doctor mark progress so how's it going %HESITATION %HESITATION craziness I mean good stuff but %HESITATION it's a lot of irons in the fire you know that feeling you're not slowing down there's too much to do okay I know mark pretty well so I figured I just start out by immediately putting him on the spot do you remember when we met when we met well let's see I remember you an undergraduate at Tufts %HESITATION it was two thousand seven which seems like forever ago thirteen almost fourteen years ago now and I was taking conservation bio class and you came and gave us a guest lecture as part of and I think it was it was basically talking about the importance of wild life health and how that relates to conservation and conservation biology in you common start giving your lecture and it was one of those moments where it was like the the two neurons like finally connected in my brain words like wildlife conservation network %HESITATION you can do you %HESITATION is this is awesome it was just that that like oh my god aha yep moment and just I remember sitting in the back and just just soaking in everything you were saying in the whole lecture and I was you know like much of the way in the back of this lecture hall and I was just like my goodness I I need to talk to him and I'm way in the back and I just I remember I vividly remember this I'm just climbing over the seats the lecture hall literally like pushing people out of the way I'm like no I'm at which you know me well enough and you know that's so out of character for me and I you know I get kind of a friend a lecture hall and you're there and I was all excited and then I didn't know what to say crap I forgot the plan and what a good asking what am I going to say and you were just so nice and gracious and I think you know I kind of scribbled my email on a piece of paper and handed it to you and you did the same and that's where it all started and here we are all these years later sitting in front of microphones together that's that's fine and think about all the marvelous things you've done in between it's interviews not about me I really keeps pushing the spot light back on you but you know I really without getting like to overly sentimental one of the reasons why I wanted to have you as one of our first guest on this podcast is because you really have been the the pivotal person in my career saying it face to face %HESITATION soon to do I thank you so much you you've really been the person that helped me cut sheet my career and and help me get to where I am and I'm just so grateful pleased and honored and overjoyed to have been able to do that with you but we're not done yet right it's over we thirteen years we have a long way to get we have a lot of unfinished projects to work on and I was sort of sitting back and philosophizing Fuhrman this is you know I get to be to gray beard and you know I'm struck by beard and think about this kind of thing and you and I have had this conversation before you know what I think about what I've been doing for me %HESITATION professionally for I mean %HESITATION this is fifty years at this point this is a long I can't believe it's been five decades or or or %HESITATION I mean you know how I sell myself you know I'm basically an educator and I clinician and you know if I've said to you inside the van and send the by the other people I don't consider myself a brilliant researcher you know %HESITATION what I if I've got a super power if I've got a strength I think my strengths is working with other people and and networking and you know it's sitting down with young people like you %HESITATION yes I know when we recorded this interview it was actually my thirty sixth birthday so thanks mark for calling me a young person how did the journey to becoming the the mark progress but you are today how did that happen when I met you you were kind of in the last decade of your like I say the last decade of your career because I think you have several more days to go well I guess you're the last decade pre retirement career so I kind of came in towards the end so there's this whole kind of backstory of how you got interested in where I live health what made you go to that school from the time I was tiny you know I I've been wanting to be outdoors and play with credits and so you know we lived on a farm %HESITATION %HESITATION lawyers ville road and you know I could walk out in the back and go forever into the woods and they were ponds and there was a %HESITATION I should %HESITATION beef cattle next door I member huge pole there is that I was not supposed to climb over the fence to visit so %HESITATION you know across the street there was %HESITATION when I think back a very poor family the sliders and they had a son Sonny Slater who is sort of my age and his father was one of those local guys who just made a living whatever he can do you know he help with paying in the fall but one of the things he did was traffic and so when I went over to their house he was always getting something hello you know there were bodies around and there was scams out Iraq's drive all my gosh is that where your interest in pathology that's where it all back I have no idea but I did so clearly remember the smells in the scams and things like that for the sunny slated sports %HESITATION in council skills so so that stuff was sort of imprinted into may so aside from being surrounded by dead animal parts Mike what a pretty normal childhood spending lots of time outside and growing up with an appreciation for the natural world but then in middle school his whole life was uprooted but anyway when I was in seventh grade %HESITATION my father came home one day and he said what would you think about moving to Mexico %HESITATION yeah and my mother was my mother was a little hesitant at first yeah and so and so we did moving into the U. S. because of his father's job mark spent a year in Mexico and then moved to Venezuela for high school and it was in the midst of %HESITATION the FAA Outlander revolutionary Cuban movement trying to take over the Venezuelan government so there were it heavily armed police around you know our school got shot only one day bye bye bye revolution nobody got hurt but you know it was but it was just kind of international stuff you know when when you went to lunch you'd be sitting with you know Edgar for me C. O. P. %HESITATION and merry from England hi D. from Holland you know and you'd be tight everybody would bring different stuff for lunch and you know be reading different languages and that kind of cultural richness and learning to appreciate one another as human beings was just a phenomenal experience %HESITATION you know opens your eyes in ways that you know being a seventh grader with New Jersey never did I mean I had great teachers in New Jersey but it was a very typical suburban experience living in Latin America for those years really helped shape marks world view and although he didn't know it at the time help prepare him for his future career as a wildlife at creekside way back to when I was little and living and Coble scale because one of the stories my grandparents used to tell us if they bring me toys for like my birthday or holiday said bring a big truck or a bicycle and what they say is they give mark the toy and then they go in the other room to do grown up stuff and they come back and mark would have taken the part B. empire were pieces on the floor I've always liked taking things apart to figure out how they work you know toys computers animals whatever it happens to be and so when I was a kind I'm our when I was in Latin America you know when they shot something for dinner %HESITATION I would always volunteer to scan you know or you know open it up and see how it I was always fascinated you know has a crocodile put together housing and I kind of put together has a bird yeah I can totally see where markets is levels comparative anatomy so that's what a few years after high school mark's family moved back to the U. S. and at one point mark almost decided to become a professional musician and so I was thinking about doing that and my father who's a very wise man said do you know about the life of the musician and so he's made arrangements with a professional musician for me to go out on the road for a few weeks and I did that and I decided to become a buyer you know living doing one night stands and serving out of a suitcase at eating junk was yeah it was not what I wanted to be oh my gosh I think well thank god so mark went on to study biology and ecology at Cornell University and he also had an interest in marine biology but apparently that didn't work out in high school I kept writing to Jacques Cousteau to be right back he never you know I I would rather I would write you up all the time said can I come work for you next summer I really wanted to work but you know he never ride back so late never right back then after Cornell this is the height of the Vietnam War and I was I had a low draft number but it was it was an interesting time and so after college I didn't want to take a full time job right away because I was still trying to work things out with the draft and figure out you know where I was going to be for the next two years and I took a job as a field research assistant and spent the next almost a year in the field collecting C. O. date on Australia day ending on the end to end service let's say we're looking at the effects of D. D. T. %HESITATION %HESITATION spray embryo development NHL sickness and things like that this is just before DDT was banned %HESITATION and so I would drive you know climb up Todd Stratton S. said waving Yang and take the %HESITATION had stags to drive over to ask you substance lab at Princeton for analysis and learn all about the environmental toxicology and effects from a big you know the the poorly paid low on the totem pole filesystem okay so we can kind of see where this is going now in this field biologists position is where mark first got his experience working with wild birds and his first experience with eco toxicology but a little while later there was one fateful night that really set him on his future path %HESITATION I was driving home one night %HESITATION the thirty two well anyway I was driving home one night and I saw something flopping at the side of the road and I stopped to pick it up and it was so hot that have been hit by a car and I stuck in the box in the car and try to find help for and no but there weren't be ability to surround I called a couple of veterinarian said I didn't know what to do with it but we would not far from brigantine National Wildlife Refuge so I drove over there %HESITATION very nice folks they were concerned they didn't know what to do with it but they said well let's hear a case what you can do so they let me out of wire cage took it home the bird died overnight yeah and I went yeah yeah somebody must know something to do about this and I got frustrated with it long story short %HESITATION my wife and I talked to the people that brigantine and talk to some of the local section and we ended up opening a rehabilitation center in our backyard %HESITATION and over the next few years it became what at that point was the largest your vocation center on the east coast debut in the A. B. M. A. R. C. give me the location my gosh I had no idea yeah and so you know I was doing all the ecology stuff I was interested in conservation I was working in that area and we're taking care of her day animals and I kept taking the animals to veterinarians I have a couple of that's always working with %HESITATION Ralph Warner was one of the best ones and fabulous static Pam grad who would try anything really good surgeon and he encouraged me a lot of ways %HESITATION and so it %HESITATION you know I was still waiting orthopedic surgery under Easter on the dining room table free for years %HESITATION %HESITATION you know I I I I I estimate I died several thousand orthopedic surgeries before I applied to vet school the whole time %HESITATION %HESITATION yeah despite all his work and wildlife rehab at this point in the story works still thought he didn't have what it takes to become of that but sometimes all we need is a little encouragement and so %HESITATION I was looking to graduate school and I was looking at PhD programs and not installed with them for a variety of positions and it was actually a friend of mine Lee Rosen sent who took me out to dinner give me career advice and he said have you ever thought about veterinary medicine and my answer was no %HESITATION the guy who is doing Cobre surgeries on the dining room %HESITATION yeah but that's because I like to take things apart %HESITATION and and and it was because I had been cut out as an undergraduate by all the pre med mmhm I remember saying to Lee I I can't do that they were all so smart you know they would take it you know four six three and biochemistry for N. P. cabin all this stuff that I can I can't I'm not that kind of academic %HESITATION and he said you don't have to and so again long story short started a learning about veterinary schools you have to write letters back then so I applied the first year to I think six or seven schools %HESITATION didn't get into any of them %HESITATION I got didn't get an interview no I did I got an interview or tops I was the only interview I got it was tough first year they were you know they were looking for their first year they opened and what what year was that this would have been nineteen seventy nine %HESITATION and didn't get in anywhere went back to teaching and this was the year that %HESITATION we found out I had cancer and I had to have surgery I lost my word %HESITATION yep that's a twist in the story I bet you didn't see coming and so is the second year that I was applying to veterinary school I had just had my leg amputated that didn't deter you at all it sounds like you just were like oh yeah we got rid of that pesky leg like let's just charge forward you know but I'm sure there's more it's way more than that and and I'm trying to shorten the story we can we can get a we can talk about that for a long time if you want it it was like it gave me something to live for you know I was so despondent %HESITATION you know I was this out to a person who had spent looking for a career hi George climbing trees and it just cut my leg off %HESITATION and still having this goal it was just like just lighting a fire no I'm going to do this come hell or high water %HESITATION I applied the next year %HESITATION and had two interviews wanted pen and one of top no or else and the one of Penn was interesting was the committee interview or five or six people and all they wanted to talk about with my disability I'm fine how can you do that %HESITATION and I went in the review to tufts and and I talked about that for five minutes but that but not much I interviewed without John is here with the first team and Bob cook %HESITATION in a Klein %HESITATION respiratory guy and %HESITATION believe for without apology %HESITATION and so it's entirely different issue they were more concerned that I wanted to do wildlife because they thought nobody does that medicine %HESITATION while I've got the crazy career so we talked about that and I think I convinced them that there was something that and %HESITATION that's a brown creeper resting on the tree %HESITATION really cool %HESITATION %HESITATION and so %HESITATION I said I think tough let me N. because they were just in three you know kind of like we've never we've never seen anything like this before he yeah they're like I don't know let's let's see where this with this guy can do sure you know %HESITATION and and tell us was wonderful about it yeah I remember sitting down with the date and with Bob cook who is associate dean at that point and they were going to be infinitely flexible with their with the clinical part of the curriculum Bob cook said if it's any clinical rotations that you feel would be dangerous or that you don't want to do let us know and we'll find alternative yeah and I was stubborn I was I was like well I'm gonna try all what's happened I just checked my account you know this is %HESITATION %HESITATION so yeah %HESITATION so I did the mall %HESITATION and got through it and made wonderful friends and you know I have made a career in wildlife medicine but probably I remember my second interview because I came in %HESITATION you know with one leg on crutches whether wig not a hair on my body from chemotherapy %HESITATION I not an eyebrow no no nothing %HESITATION %HESITATION and %HESITATION and I hadn't thought about it but there were people interfering that year who's been in the interview with me the year before when I had a beard and to lead %HESITATION it's great and and I'll never forget the look at Lisa S. man's face when she figured out it was still may %HESITATION it was fly you you know that probably was one of the hardest things about that second interview with dealing with the feelings of the people %HESITATION yeah because I wasn't prepared for that I'm glad you told that whole story because I feel like in all the years I've known you I kind of just don't think about it you know I don't I don't think of you as having a disability or you know having a handicapped and it's not something that I feel like has limited you in anyway at least in the years that I know you I mean do you feel like as you went forward in your career you had to make different choices or what did it %HESITATION absolutely absolutely absolutely yeah yeah %HESITATION you know there's a lot of I I think it's kept me from a whole variety of of field work that I would have liked to have done you know I can't Kerrier forty pound pack I walk ten miles you know I I can't easily get very high up in a tree I mean I can manage it with you know ropes and client Joe Mars and things like that but it's it's hard %HESITATION particular as I get older you know my wife doesn't let me go up on a ladder with a chainsaw anymore %HESITATION so don't know why so this is one that has shaped what I've got you know I've worked %HESITATION I've worked a lot with smaller wildlife the big stuff because I can handle the %HESITATION my you know my cheese %HESITATION and you know dealing with F. you know four hundred pound lying around three thousand pound elephant %HESITATION you know not that I haven't played around with them a little bit but yeah it's like it's the Levinson lemonade story yeah now if I had to do it over again but I would choose to have my work you like now are you crazy %HESITATION but on the other hand one unexpected benefit of the whole thing is no one never forgets meeting me and I'm not saying I'm a rock star and it's not because of my skills but you know when I go to a session and meeting our society for conservation biology meeting %HESITATION while I've society meeting I'm pretty much the only A. I. P. T. that your program you're you're the one like it wonder well thank you for that as often in our profession you know I mean in many of the things that you and I do it used to be that there weren't any women in the room you know that it was all males actioner for male wildlife biologists that has changed dramatically %HESITATION it used to be and it still is in many meetings that there aren't many African Americans in the row you know that's something we have to work on changing you know I mean to me and this goes back to growing up you know overseas I mean to me diversity is fabulous diversity is wonderful diversity as strikes %HESITATION diversity is the world all right interjection here because this issue of diversity in veterinary medicine is so important in twenty thirteen the bureau of labor statistics actually found that veterinary medicine was the widest profession in America at over ninety six percent so obviously this is a huge issue that we need to work on shut up to the national association for black veterinarians and all the other groups working to address this issue of diversity inclusion in veterinary medicine also check out some of the links in the show notes so where do we go we're it's a great question one of the things that you've done is I kind of think of you as one of the founding people of the whole conservation medicines old I realize we could do a whole episode just on that but maybe give us a a brief overview of how that came together the pieces have always been that that a quote from the by the eighteen sixties for bird out very cal out there shouldn't be a difference between human medicine animal medicine car and I don't have the quote precisely right but you remember the one I'm talking about that quote he's thinking of us from German physician Rudolph workout also known as the father of modern pathology his famous eighteen fifty six quote reads between animal and human medicine there is no dividing line nor should there be there it all is one house %HESITATION %HESITATION you know across the fina has said this very eloquently and some of his writing is that we're all part of an evolutionary continue one you know I mean we think about humans having a cell in humans having a heart you meant having a digestive system well we inherited from fish yeah it's the same system just modified to do a few different things %HESITATION and so this is a new sought it I think it keeps coming up roughly every forty years or so and so when I was a vet student before I reset that state when I was thinking of applying to veterinary school the way I first heard about tough was an aunt she was living in Boston sent me a little clipping from the globe about a new vet school that was gonna be opening in Massachusetts a sort of and seventy eight problem which she sent it to me and that's the side that sort of thing and it had in it the term %HESITATION one medicine and the word environment and I had never up until then see know what word environment in any publication for many veterinary school yeah and I thought I need to find out more about this yeah and it turns out that the key piece was the first day that they hired al Jonas a great advocate for the one medicine concept and so the idea of one of the ways that he sold and this idea to the trustees of Tufts University is he said we can keep costs down by having a bunch of sherry courses between the medical students in the veterinary students will put him all in the same classroom teacher while at the same time and save costs and John my A. the president the stocks at that point and the board product %HESITATION and it worked for a little while so that's one reason we started in downtown Boston with the classes yes when I back when I was a boy when I was in school we had a series of shared classes with the medical stirred physiology with a shared class you know all the first year medical students all the first year veterinary students and a big auditorium and patent patent B. %HESITATION taking it together it was a disaster for a variety of reasons but and again I did go in to stories about that %HESITATION but the idea was we get to know one another as standards and risk we get to respect one another's expertise to begin to share ideas and cross disciplinary boundaries and there was a lot of talk around that you know the late seventies to the mid eighties about once the one medicine concept and pandemics and all that sort of thing I mean that with an active discussion %HESITATION zero al wasn't the dean after a while and relationship with the medical school physical for a whole variety of different reasons and the idea sort of went downhill but people still had it in the back of their minds and I think the veterinary community was always much more excited about it and the medical committee was so the initial idea of having the bed students and the vet students all learning together as one big happy family didn't last but that concept of Schering knowledge across disciplines didn't fizzle they just needed to take a slightly different approach so we are wildlife program the tops %HESITATION and this would have been mid nineties I was taking over as head of the wildlife program and we also have an international veterinary medicine program attached it was being run by Dave Sherman at that point to have been a large animal faculty member wonderful guy and Dave and I had a lot of common interest %HESITATION and actually did some overseas working Mexico together %HESITATION and we had an international student group IBM and we had a while I've student groups and they would meet separately and David Hyde print lunch one day talk about our student groups and we realized you know seventy or eighty percent of what the international group is doing is identical to what the wildlife group if they're right they're just doing it in Africa versus this group is doing it here but it's the same stuff in terms of animal health and wildlife intersected with domestic animals and human health conservation market this idea to start some kind of program that focused on those intersections between wildlife domestic animals humans and the environment but to get this kind of thing off the ground he needed money so he went and met with the trustee of the rest missing foundation to see if they would want to fund that kind of thing David I went in and we sat in his office overlooking Boston Harbor big fancy asked office I N. dot talk about this and he was quite interested me idea and he said you know it's a great idea but he said you're missing something we look at one another he said federal insurance don't know everything I was to know he said we would consider finding something like this if you would involve more the human health aspect and in the end they did end up getting that grant to start the program it tops but then they realized they didn't have a name for this thing they were doing literally over a bottle of wine with a couple of students %HESITATION invented the term conservation medicine we said what are we gonna call this group and we went through a whole bunch of staging a one health is been use it go health was a big term at that point so we didn't want to go health we didn't want one Madison we wanted something that had more of a conservation flavor to it then the medicine flavor to because we wanted animals and ecosystems to be the focus rather than human help and so that's why it came up with the term conservation medicine so then we got a big graph from the Vachon Rasmussen foundation a hundred and fifty thousand dollars over five years %HESITATION and started the center for conservation medicine Johns Hopkins was a member Harvard was a member wildlife trust was a member we have many of our meetings on the graft and campus but we also had meetings in New York City it buries office and have an international conference and published %HESITATION those two books on conservation Madison and there you have it the entire field of conservation medicine started over a bottle of wine I love it now that we've heard the story of how conservation medicine started I wanted to wrap up the interview by thinking about the future I'm curious where you think conservation medicine is going or where we need to go we're we're would you like to see it go quiz conservation medicine I think the way we get forwarded this field is in general not by the individual brilliance of any one of us I need you know yeah either you know right yes yeah we'll send %HESITATION jade could all %HESITATION you know David Attenborough or so I mean it's something we can work towards but I think the progress that we have made in the progress that we're going to make it's because of our %HESITATION putting our heads together on our collaborative skill sets you know it started out many years ago is regional and then it became national and more and more it's international and of course the big problems that we're facing our items of that magnitude whether we talk about the conservation of one species like common lessons or whether we talk about things that are truly global like climate change and pollution and %HESITATION things of that nature we need everybody involved in this stuff I guess I got to the age round and more and more convinced that we're not gonna have any fundamental changes in human nature you know we're or fascinating species we wanna work together we want to collaborate but it's it's like magnets you know you you you get the wrong faces about this too close together they push against one another and so this this approach avoid missing %HESITATION and I've seen this in my life rehabilitation I seen conservation I've seen it that's my medicine maybe I'm on usual in that I feel so much stronger %HESITATION the attraction parts in the riposte in part because like I which would involve from something like but nobody's instead of something like chimpanzees so that we were better at this community collaboration stuff and not quite so aggressive in our information what's the waiter waiting to increase communication and collaboration in a way that's realistic and it may be a lot of what you're doing today %HESITATION and what a lot of us are trying to do with internet tools but let's increase the bandwidth of those collaborative tools for Schering information I made that up but it feels good yeah no I love it I love it yeah so what's next for mark program well I'm gonna have to get off this phone because I've got another exam to get on to talk about building tools but but %HESITATION you know I like a lot of what I'm doing now I feel like I'm working with fabulous people %HESITATION I feel like I'm at a point in my career I don't I don't need my name on anything you know I don't need to be the first author on another page I'm not going for ten years you know or anything no I don't need to be the P. I. on a grant %HESITATION what I want to be as a facilitator it's a great joy that I get out of this is is making the collaboration work better you know I am I feel like I'm successful when the people that I love and respect and work with our successful and so the more that I can achieve that better I'm gonna feel every day thanks for listening to another episode of the wildlife health connections podcast if you liked what you heard go hit that subscribe button and leave this review you can check us out on social media for some good content and advance notice about coming up so you can also get more information %HESITATION wildlife health dot O.
