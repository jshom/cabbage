in order for you and me need to devise some kind of method or strategy to offset some of the van sorry %HESITATION repetition of the events that have taken place here in Los Angeles recently sports league suffering a big blow with cancellations across the board it's also a problem for all the sports gambling companies that have turned into big business over the past two or three years just a few months ago to sports gambling industry with riding high with more more legal places to that and money pouring in from companies hoping to capitalize on the growing market now would live games on pause so too is activity for sports books around the world to shut down better creative looking for action on everything from Taiwanese hoops to Russian table tennis today we explore how the short of getting by and whether the industry's luck will ever return I mean time it's Tuesday April fourteenth this is E. S. P. N. David I got a hot tip for you I live in Los Angeles it's going to be between sixty five and seventy five degrees over the next two months thank you to the bank yeah just go just go throw down on it it'll be sunny kind like what was that L. A. story was the old movie was the farm your automatic system the same day I think the odds makers are on to that one you know what we'll try to find some vulnerabilities in the betting market done because you're in it the sports betting analyst for E. S. P. N. and the host of the daily wager Doug one of my favorite movie quotes of all time is when Dr Ian Malcolm interested park says life finds a way and that's kind of how I feel about sports betting right now because at a moment when it would seem like there is literally nothing nothing you can bet on gambling finds a way and we we really do in the betting world you know it's certainly been interesting it is challenged us but you know what the beauty of the internet we're all finding a way to kind of move forward but obviously it's %HESITATION very different sort of towing on everything welcome back to the week or the days in which it really started to hit everyone that sports was coming to a standstill %HESITATION right when the N. B. A. pas games what are you hearing in the better world at the time well it was certainly taking everyone sort of catch everyone off guard if you remember the NC double a had their conference tournaments and the next day all these champ we games are gonna be played with no fans so in terms of just pure handicapping a lot of people are trying to understand get a feel for like what %HESITATION no fans would sort of have an effect on just what would be the over unders and all that and then the NBA was postponed for the time being the breaking news from the NBA tonight on what will be the final night of the season for a period of time as play will be suspended following this evening's play and then everyone is really sort of taking back because it was such a means March madness everything sister like an exciting time of year and then it's really kind of short guys professional better start to try to figure this out and got ahead of the curve a little bit and then I started reading the Brooklyn nets which were obviously one of the more seeds in the east but if the if the N. B. A. layoffs gets delayed a couple of months maybe Kevin Durant returns and it's healthy enough in Tyree Irving as well so a team that was released expected to be first round spotter all of a sudden could actually be a change which can container now we're talking a hundred fifty to one odds so that's sort of have a better community work so we just the NBA by its nature of the load management is always about angling to see who subbing it out trying to kind of beat the market so you're trying to get an advantage anyway you can %HESITATION in all sports and then the severity of the situation started %HESITATION sat in and you're like wait a minute this might be a really long time here so there is news events and things that could be happening in the distant future but obviously with sports now there are far fewer opportunities to bet on games matches competitions but there are some opportunities right you're looking at sports overseas that aren't normally bet like Taiwan hoops %HESITATION they still play in Chinese Taipei there's some there's some teams out there %HESITATION better return bettors Nicaragua baseball going on right now so we're seeing table tennis in the Ukraine and Russia being bad all right thanks guys Sergei mag call takes on Yevgeny you can four thirty P. M. eastern start time in the Russian leader pro table tennis organization like mad cost in this match up here give me Sir gay mag call off getting the job done for some money like cash anything that people can sort of get their sort of %HESITATION fixed on is really helpful so it's been pretty strange to people who are used to reading but just the conventional sports are the NBA and NFL and everything %HESITATION do you think some of the money that would have gone to the NBA or March madness has been flowing into Russian table tennis I talked to one odds maker who kind of overseas a big operation and about it and he says total in one day he got he gets close to six figures so that's that's all the games throughout one day all the properties and that includes live betting now they can't people can't even watch this you can track it online it sounds like a lot it's not really that much but I tell you there in the off shore world there is some crazy stuff going on with E. sports and video games I know you're Tyler on your show not too long ago here and talked about just the growth of the sport what the betting any sports is also growing during this downtime is that a fairly new phenomena well you know it's it was supposed to take off a couple of years ago and it never did so I I would say it hasn't taken off in this in the states it's more it's bigger offshore but just so people understand it's it's gamers right it's one of the best gamers in the world playing couple types of video games against other top gamers but what's also kind of taking storm and I just noticed it with B. offshore world not in the states yet is you people being able to bet on just simulated games news sports is like gamers streamer vendors just anybody's played Xbox or PlayStation or whatever when they play like a sports game you can kind of and in the setup page you move your controller to whatever team you want to control what you don't want your controller all the controllers are just in the middle of the computer is just play each other the the computer just press play in the complete computer plays itself which is basically a simulation just a straight like bell curve outcome and they're putting point spreads on this and it's like an hour for basketball games thirty minutes for a hockey game I know %HESITATION and what this is and I've had to learn all this it's it's on twitch all right so on twitch there are different channels and there is %HESITATION primetime action there's an MBA one some some sports books are like my bookies offering a channel there's all different kind of sports in different simulations all off Maddon for NFL and you can just grab a simulator game it's not even about anyone playing like E. sports is those are professional players professional gamers this is literally just a computer playing itself out the betting market that tight probably not but %HESITATION it is been fascinating to watch different sports books off shore sort of expander betting menu each week realizing that there's a little bit of a demand for this and you look at it what is gaining sort of geared towards eighteen to thirty four that's what betting it so there's a strong overlap with light E. A. sports and Matt and all that with the betting community %HESITATION %HESITATION so what are some of the weird or things that people are betting on well that's what's interesting so just %HESITATION required just to clarify to our audience %HESITATION we have sixteen states in the US right now that have legal sports betting to actually the week that we talked about champ week that AB sports go away slow little coincidental but so states %HESITATION %HESITATION sports betting is legal in Nevada and and fifteen other states in New Jersey being one of the more other prominent once in an off shore world has a lot more liberties shall I say and latitude in terms of what they can offer it's not as regulated a betting markets and that's when it starts getting pretty silly right so you can bet on B. simulations %HESITATION they haven't been legalized yet in the U. S. of the simulations all go off or off shore but then there is getting really crazy stuff I mean you can bet on bees coronavirus press conferences whether B. trump says X. Y. how long he speaks before questions things like that and then you can bet on the Dow Jones and I'm talking the last two digits of the Dow Jones %HESITATION there's like no handicapping involved it's like %HESITATION it's a it's a poll of a slot machine lever right like there's just nothing in there giving you as many options you can again they want to kind of keep their clientele until sports returns so yeah you can bet on the NBA NFL draft you can bet on stuff this coming fall like that you know whatever chiefs to win the Superbowl and other futures that is normal even the potential tiger river still match up would you cannot they're also offering props on like lotteries for very states %HESITATION just really ridiculous things that I mean it's like the weather I mean that my mom used to joke about that when I was in high school like %HESITATION a little bit on anything like the weather that's actually like where we're at right now really see that's actually a something you could actually you know do some research on and make a more educated I think you're mentioning I haven't traveled like because that's obviously not my forte but like like I said the Dow Jones I mean you can kind of handicapped that but when you're talking bout the the last digit of the last two digits of the Dow Jones it's just random whatever store again they want a betting man you that is S. as a lot of options our bunch people betting the stuff course not but you just want to look busy because you don't want to lose it to you know someone across the street so to speak all right after the break let's talk about how all of this has impacted the betting industry hi guys given everything that is happening in the world right now most of us are buying things online I saw that eighteen T. started doing to really help with things for those who want to buy a new phone or device online they're offering fast free non contact livery and curbside pickup so the only shopping is a simple and safe as possible on top of that they have a flexible return policy so you can shop please you can visit A.

T. dot com to learn how to shop online from the safety of your home twenty four seven seven exchange restrictions apply Doug you mentioned all of the state's swear betting is now legal very responsibly thank you for that cab yes and it struck me you know there is a lot of momentum in this space over the last two years because of what's been happening in Washington and what's been happening with the industry do you think this risk stopping that momentum to some degree I actually do because as you can very well no it's probably not going to just jump back to normal whenever games to return but whenever we do get back to games it doesn't mean like the economy is going to be back so Wallace I'm optimistic and hopeful and all that good stuff I just don't know if that disposable income will be there on day one as well and I think the words can be gun shy whether unemployment rates pretty high so user definitely concerning times for the sports book industry and I I know you're in Iraq and a laugh about sort of what's out there and this is all sort of %HESITATION entertainment stuff but in terms of like the U. S. impacted sports books and all those employees especially in Las Vegas which is a three shift town because it's a twenty four hour township three ships and the the community's been really hit hard I mean nine hundred forty three casinos in the US had all been shut down I was courting American gaming association thirty gambling facilities you know six hundred forty nine thousand gaming employees mix you know closures because it's not just sports betting but at the casinos and managed a hospitality industry so it's been a real big blow to the to the sports book in the sports in the casino industry and I actually lived in Vegas for seven years before U. S. P. N. when I was there during the two thousand eight financial crisis and that was obviously a real estate bubble that popped in nobody felt at worst in Vegas so I was there and saw it it was real tough but I I won't even say this which makes things worse I mean that was mostly American issue the the two thousand eight Hehe but this is global so we don't so %HESITATION so the Las Vegas doesn't have the tourism money coming in like they did maybe a decade ago and it's been a real big blow before all of this went down the kind of iris pandemic you were talking about doing an episode on March madness because the NC double a tournament is massive for betting how big of a deal is it that it didn't happen it's huge %HESITATION and I reference the American gaming association they did an estimate and that if things are closed for too much B. estimate is forty three and a half billion B. as in boy in economic activity that's generated by casinos that will be lost that makes sense I I talked to one odds maker that or the head of Caesar sports book and you said that first Friday of March madness opening weekend so like a two bit of brown one is the second biggest day of total money bad a beer the first being obviously Superbowl but in terms of betting impact March madness is just huge is just there to talk about in the back it's bigger than the Superbowl because it counts so many so many days so the turn it didn't happen but one event that is still happening is the N. F. L. draft %HESITATION which has been a godsend to those of us in the NFL content pervading industry %HESITATION but I imagine also to betting right because there's a lot of betting around that bend yeah that's going to be the first thing that sort of fuels like the old days right because we don't need games for the NFL draft is a lot of %HESITATION offseason sort of discussion and we all sort of bad the N. F. L. draft based on the mock drafts that service even during this global pandemic not much has changed now the interview process for the teams in the in the scouting and all that is change we don't have some of the pro workouts but for the most part the consumers the betters or it's going to feel like nothing's changed so sports book operators that I talk to are anticipating a huge handle now the initial draft legal in the state has been around for in terms of just be option be option to bed so that's a lot the last couple of years so each year they've been able to add more options on the betting menu so inevitably the handle was going to go up no matter what but now just sort of people chomping at the bit want to sort of fire on some on draft props what have been some of the more interesting profits you seen around the draft so you can drop you can bet on sort of where like the number a guy just picked fort which team picks a guy so I mean you can do total ride receivers in the first first round total number of running backs I I think the wide receiver thing is kind of interesting six and a half is the number at Caesars we only have seven wide receivers draft in the first round in one year and that was two thousand four so sort of well before that passing game shift we saw around two thousand nine two thousand ten was Leri fitz Gerald here but still seven wide receivers in %HESITATION for sort of surprised me there's a fun profits S. C. C. verse the field in the first round so who's going to have more players in the field is minus a half but means the field has to have seven so not how many non SEC players seventeen or more first SEC fifteen with all the Alabama LSU and in all respects expected that one or two guys in the first round so that's fine and then there's the total number of quarterbacks we know the top three or we think we DO Jordan love making it for but will there be S. yes J. could be sent out of %HESITATION Washington formally Georgia's figures to be the fifth I guess from the Georgia to be could be set up as well you alluded to this earlier but even though there's a lot of uncertainty right now about the NFL season when and whether it'll start %HESITATION you know people are still betting on features Super Bowl winner that sort of thing has actually been more betting on the upcoming NFL season because it's still being scheduled in there so much little asked that on right now well there's always going to be sort of a shot in the arm whenever something kinda happens like Brady to Tampa Bay the contract is signed Tom Brady now officially a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers so anytime there's news people like to better weather be just free agency in general and as you very well know me know there was a lot of quarterbacks moving teams about always sort of move the needle so to speak so on the whole %HESITATION you know it does sound like betting is finding ways to muddle through this even with perhaps decreased volume do you think the industry is going to change as a result well it all depends on sports tips Sports returns in the way we saw it as of a couple months ago and all the weeds get back and fans everywhere and all that in due time I think's sports betting will return as well as long as the economy recovers but it's going to take some time I mean obviously games have to return and then kind of the economy a stick return as well you mentioned that all this is contingent on sports returning can you bet on Wynn's sports will return you can also bet on when sports will return they had props on like the Kentucky Derby and things like that now there's sort of a demarcation what's called a July first I want to say a couple books are offering before or after July first for the NBA and NHL they're doing NFL September tenth like will they start on time and you can bet on that now again limits are really low odds change every day with updates like I talked about earlier about current events and storylines if there is one you can bet on it we're probably the sea tiger King profit product pretty soon it's like who's going to play jugs on Bob Thorton thanks so much you got a really appreciate you having me on coming up Y. Simone Biles is not like you and me and is there so much more represented by merece on now more than ever we have to look out for each other and count on each other American once you know that you can count on them for high quality type tear gas well we are aware travel might not be top of mind there might be times we have to hop in the car to run errands maybe a drop of groceries reply to your family maybe you've become an amazing Baker and want to drop off a few dozen cookies on your best friend's porch or maybe you just want to drive around to all different homes simply away from a safe distance before you head out remember to fuel up at marathon marathon gasoline's are formulated with S. T. P. added is to keep your vehicle running at peak performance by optimizing fuel economy removing those I we deposit build ups and reducing emissions remember wherever you need to go the people it merits on our behind you all the way Mehrestan fueling the American spirit here's another story I want you to know %HESITATION this past weekend you may have come across a viral video of American gymnast Simone Biles doing something called the handstand challenge it's hard to do justice to video on words but basically Simone who is wearing sweat pants goes into a full handstand than what she's remaining in the handstand uses her feet to take off her sweat pants as some friends cheer her on setting aside the fact that most of us need to be challenged to simply put on pants these days I enjoy this very much but it also made me a little sad because the service reminder as we head into the summer that we should be getting excited to watch files dominate in the Olympics which of course have been postponed until next year this is W. sad for piles because as Neil Paine pointed out in a recent piece for five three eight the Olympics timeline has been unusually cruel to her she's twenty four years old which is young and normal people years but pretty old and gymnastics and despite her incredible dominance she's only competed and won Olympic Games in twenty sixteen warrant alone put her in the conversation for one of the greatest don't ever be you can't help us think of what might have been twelve miles turned fifteen years old which made her in eligible to compete in the games that year the minimum ages sixteen and it wasn't always the case until nineteen ninety six Jim it's only under turned fifteen in the year of the Olympics to be eligible for the senior national team it seems likely that if moan had competed that year she probably would have meddled because you're later she won her first all around gold at the world championships so if the rules had changed file to be entering twenty twenty with true Olympics under her belt perhaps approaching her final competition instead she is looking at only her second games and she has yet to confirm if she'll compete if she does compete imagine she will she'll be defying the odds not counting rhythmic gymnast only three female tennis over the age of twenty two have won any sort of Olympic gold since nineteen seventy two and the oldest when the individual all around gold in that time frame with Simone %HESITATION in our two thousand who is weeks shy every twenty first birthday now what all that said I am not bedding ensemble and neither should you she has not lost in all around competition since two thousand thirteen and we all just all she could beat the pants off anyone I mean times and this is B. E. S. P. N. daily I'll talk to you tomorrow %HESITATION
 
%HESITATION %HESITATION for starters you know as you may know more series is one of the St Martin capitals of the willing %HESITATION %HESITATION it's a really cool place to just walk around and mera Zana is painted all over there are pictures of him with halos their pictures of him %HESITATION and so wet and there are bigger road pictures in their tiny little stencils he is literally everywhere %HESITATION right Thompson is a senior writer for ESPN we asked him to share his reporting on soccer legend Diego merit Donna and what his death means to his home country of Argentina so I'm always trying to be with with American lands but I really don't thanks there is our conversions this he came along with such a specific time in Argentina's history and he did it in a way that represented what people think of as the best of Argentina I mean he did it was did it with but she's not he did it with brilliance was dance with power everything about me %HESITATION Donna feels like it represents the Altman mess of Argentinian masculinity and Argentina citizenship the world lost one of the biggest names in sports when he giggle merit Donna died last week on November twenty fifth at age sixty the man live many lot a young soccer star for a struggling Argentina who became an infamous global icon S. is country reinvented itself nine Pablo Tory it's Wednesday December second this is E. S. P. N. right Diego Maradona died in Argentino one week ago today actually and since then we've seen both this local and international spectacle around his death but before we get into why that is why he's bigger than just soccer and deeply intertwined with national identity I want to clarify just how transcendent athlete she was hosting healer was merry don of the soccer player your marriage %HESITATION is a world champion is one of the most creative and dominant goal scores any generation the and one of the few people who ever lived could pick up a team and Kerry it on his back I Christian around all day %HESITATION war we all messy global soccer global football is a game in which many stars rise and fall almost very quickly and the first five or six years Diego bear Donna was unquestionably the best player in the world and had acquired no cultural leaning that would make him a budget and yeah he didn't require not just cultural meaning he really became this avatar for this entire national identity and that is what you're reporting from Argentina a few years ago demonstrated so clearly right so when he died at age sixty with the official calls being cardiac arrest that wasn't totally shocking given what we know about his life of truly staggering substance abuse but there are all these reports of fans trying to get to his coffin which is inside Argentina's presidential mansion they're trying to climb over the fences people are apparently chanting Diego is not dead Diego lived in the people at the coffin makes its way to the cemetery there's public morning but there's also this controversy that sprung up around how we died origin kind officials right raided the home of merit down as doctor and there is no investigation into negligence or manslaughter and it is to be clear completely plausible that merry Donna died just because of his own unabashed negligence of his health and yet there is now this other narrative emerging that it was somehow fell play what do you see in all of that I mean a lot of that flows from the dominant political orthodoxy in the country which is Peronism scholars with their whole lives studying and trying to find it but it basically it is a political C. returning C. re organizing series born out of one paroled and his wife was vita after him basically says there's no such thing as truth and so I think a lot of what you were seeing is being process from the outside world as well for an athlete when really it feels to me I mean I know what decent amount of time in Argentina it feels to me more like business as usual which is their will very soon be two sets of facts about this and there will be no mechanism and public civic or political life to sort them out %HESITATION %HESITATION and so this is the Argentina that merry Donna was born into and grows up and it is this country of intense political turmoil that turns into political violence in seventy eight when the dictatorship was in power Argentina hosted the world com and merry Donna was just a teenager at that point this rising star in the country's junior leagues set the backdrop for us right of that World Cup in nineteen seventy eight there was a military dictatorship and ran Argentina and when Argentina won the World Cup in nineteen seventy eight this government was kidnapping its own citizens putting them in concentration camps and one of the concentration camps in a facility called was so close to the stadium that the people in the sales could hear the cheering the amex group came out what is been happening blocks away from the stadium and is today were out celebrating a soccer team winning a game while their country was kidnapping and killing its own citizens Shamar people steal and almost never articulate over all of that period sort of groups in the world so Argentina which is a country that loves football soccer won the nineteen seventy World Cup and then almost I mean we had to a race because the only way to sort of keep going as a country was just let's just not talk about this thing that this brutal regime eventually does fall in the early nineteen eighties Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands a British territory and the English just destroy them out of all that bloodshed a democracy emerges in Argentina and for merry Donna he's this rising national start home and then it goes to play overseas in Spain and then in Italy where he develops this deserved frankly reputation for partying and getting in fights so smash cut to the World Cup of nineteen eighty six now merry Donna's on the Argentina national team what is that like he was the best player in the world representing a country that even though we think of it as old I mean the the Argentina he represented that World Cup was three years old I mean it would be like the United States winning a World Cup in which would have existed but in seventeen seventy nine you know when it was still trying to figure out what it was and what it could be and how we could go on and so I see exit in merits on his World Cup in Mexico in nineteen eighty six was the first answer that question all right who are we we're champions we are brilliant and dominant we are sneaky and resilient and we screwed over the English so we should be clear about what happens when Argentina gets to the quarter finals with England what happens right two goals in this game in the quarterfinals gifting that sum up everything on one hand he just punched the ball into the net and didn't get called the complaining about okay this is known as the hand of god goal for those unfamiliar and it's because merry Donna basically just admits that he cheated he doesn't the post game interview that the ball went into the net quote a little with his head in a little with the hand of god end quote and as you can imagine English word not happy the English whining about it lands on Argentinian years revolutionary war redcoat generals complaining about American it's not like people are like all we want because we there's no such thing as cheating this is war %HESITATION and he scored this call that everyone has seen even if you don't know you've seen it I mean yeah it is impossible to exist in the culture especially sports culture what I'm seeing is called he basically just once or the entire statement to I mean this is posted on display Argentinian resourcefulness and Argentinian power he had a fabulous global career before and after but in many ways Diego merit down only needed to score two goals to have people stand outside the presidential palace this week in San Diego it's not Dan in the hearts that's all he had to do not just those two goals but the way in which support those two girls and how they made people feel about themselves namely for the first time in a long time and good %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION and it's worth pointing out that Argentina doesn't just feel really good about winning they get to celebrate without shame very much unlike what happened when they won in seventy eight they are suddenly this new country with a massive massive star and it seems like they can just let it all hang out I mean it sometimes feels like J. O. MER Donna was worships twice as much for winning the World Cup it seems reasonable is because that's exactly true %HESITATION she was someone they invested very complicated ideas about their own perceived here already and then trying all right coming up right more on merit down a double imprint on Argentina and that even the worst scandal can't seem to touch %HESITATION and ever wonder just how far an extra mile really goes drive a Mercedes Benz van and find out start with a network of over two hundred and fifty authorized dealerships backed by sales force ready to help you with everything from customisation to service on vans like the Mercedes Benz sprinter that's tailored to your lifestyle with options like blind spot assist and and B.

P. van dot com offer valid through December thirty first twenty twenty so merry Donna is this on question the absolute forever hero for winning the World Cup for Argentina and he did all that really almost by himself but the flip side right to all of that glory on the field is a dark side a very dark personal life and metal started before the nineteen eighty six when so how bad did things get I don't know what the scale is %HESITATION you know I mean but it's it was a really really bad and it sat and desperate and we like to laugh to make jokes about self destruction but self destruction I mean it it is certainly fueled by just simple walled diction like let's don't romanticize it just got got addicted to cocaine and it was fun for a while he was running around Naples with the mafia and then it wasn't fun anymore I mean that's the ark of all addiction %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION there is a %HESITATION terror reference somewhere let's see yeah here's some of merit down as many transgressions for given by the people of Argentina he drunk upon in any game photographs emerged of him partying with the Napoli based come more perhaps the nastiest of the nasty Italian Macias just before his name was %HESITATION may or may not have thrown Italy Ceiriog championship he tested positive for coke in a tie in prosecutor charged him with spying cocaine prostitutes the prostitutes told unbelievable tales of your well like we're cheese fuel cocaine and look the word fueled appeared in a lot of stories as did the word allegedly a Brazilian prostitute named Susie said merry Donna hated condoms and love sucking her big toe cops monasteries arrest him with a half kilo of cocaine and he just walked away the random four stop lights in Seville Spain and his course cops chased him for a mile before you a year later he was sent home from the nineteen ninety four worldcom for performance enhancing drugs you actually smuggled more than three kilos of cocaine to Rome for the Italian mom she suffered a heart attack after an alleged overdose he went to rehab for Tarver's calling him having to cope down six parties in return after the birth of an illegitimate son merits on refuse relationship with the boy even after court ordered him to pay the judge is a botched me to pay support he said %HESITATION but that does not obligate me to see %HESITATION calls for him I mean it goes on and on and on right I am processing all of those details attempting to and I am so curious how fans of his and his country how they process this how do they process all of those insane details %HESITATION merry Donna is in people's hearts has nothing to do with merry Donna or anything merits ana did the only thing that matters of those two goals against thing and so our ability to ignore inconvenient facts is just part of sports fandom but combine that with the the need for someone like merry donis three years after the first presidential election in Argentina combined with the sort of cultural muscle memory of Peronism and the lack of the objective truths and I think that the love for mera dawn I exist in that sort of magical place to be online which and like when you try to parse it out it doesn't make sense it won't cover makes sense %HESITATION one of the most conspicuous tributes we've seen for merit Donna's desk came from the other soccer hero that is sold interwoven with Argentina in Leo messing on Sunday the superstar for Barcelona had this goal and is the legal match against us as soon Messi drives to the eighteen %HESITATION and Messi took office Jersey to reveal a merit Donna Jersey underneath %HESITATION thank you but yes they do he looks to the heavens and close this case the eagle this one's for you what did you think when you saw that man there was a lot of complicated stuff going on I mean they've had a very complicated relationship he is always been overshadowed by merits ana and frankly but just bear down a swagger and so you know messed it gets a lot of crap in Argentina Bible saying we doesn't sing the national anthem and he doesn't love the country like merit Thomas what's the country and he's never been able to replicate as Corp success with the national team and so messy as always been followed in shadows buy the best americana she has these deep feelings of love for the country C. O. often reciprocated for him to do that I mean I saw the part of Leo Messi that loves his country and %HESITATION loves his family there and %HESITATION wishes that people would feel about him one day the way they feel about merit on %HESITATION let's get into the different perceptions of these two great at the moment last week is in the books and now it's time to review the tape and prepare for this week and there is no better place to get in on all of the action then with draftkings official daily fantasy partner of the NFL and to add to this week's excitement grafting has a free shot at millions of dollars in total prizes up for grabs so if you haven't tried draftkings yet had to the apps store now because you don't want to miss this drafter lined up and feel the sweat like never before every run passing catch it means more with draftkings and it's simple just pick your line up stay under the salary cap and see how your team stacks up against the competition you haven't signed up yet what are you waiting for get in the game right from your couch download the draftkings daily fantasy app now and use code ESPN daily for a limited time new users can get a free shot at millions of dollars in prizes this week don't miss out on all of this week's action enter code ESPN daily to get a free shot at millions of dollars in prizes with your first deposit that's code yes P.

%HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION there is one away game and we had just launched %HESITATION and we lost by like one and they had hit like a buzzer beater %HESITATION %HESITATION Jeremy Lin and the former NBA guard spent this past season with the Beijing docks in the Chinese basketball association %HESITATION and you know that I think that and I I had like thirty some points but we lost and so I'm like oh shoot like everyone's going to go home %HESITATION as the most iconic Asian American basketball player ever his life in China got it %HESITATION surreal %HESITATION %HESITATION we go on the bus and the buses like surrounded by people and there's like police Beria's up a police search around and and so my okay we lost I'm not even in the mood to think about anything I don't want to talk to anybody I don't want to waste any man %HESITATION %HESITATION we get to the hotel and I was like okay be nice guy I was like I'm gonna try to sign everything a person here but they got to the point where like I couldn't get to the elevators and the hotel security didn't know what to do they couldn't control everybody and it was just like hundreds of people in there and at the end we were literally just barreling through people trying to get to the elevator and everyone's like yelling people are grabbing me like make sure it was getting grab like I would sign something and and other people like rip it out of people and it was like and do it with may have Jeremy Lin says his season in China has helped him turn a new page inspiring a decision to attempt a comeback in the NBA where he once shot through this guy like a meeting or and crash landed in like one to %HESITATION I just felt like I was a shell of myself %HESITATION today Lynn Sherr's Weidman sanity no longer concept and how his new perspective on the game hasn't feeling more ready than ever for the M. yeah nine Pablo torrei it's Wednesday November twenty fifth this yes P. N. Dale so Jeremy we have talked many times in our lives on and off since we met when you were still in college a decade ago this year actually and you've lived many lives since then which I've always enjoyed covering as a German but I really want to talk to you in this specific moment because you're just coming off this crazily fascinating season in China and you're now looking to return to the NBA so we're in the world are you right now can you set the scene for us %HESITATION I'm in power also right now I am in my bed right now doing this podcast you know Kobe Kobe podcast Kobe P. R. %HESITATION and I've been training here that %HESITATION for the last two months and you know it's been a huge grind and it's been a lot of fun and basically you know we've been %HESITATION training and then scattering for all the best places to be to play pick up and to find the best competition all through California and so right now we're in the middle of free agency and I just feel I just feel great about it in terms of just where I'm at mentally physically everything about it training and playing basketball every day so you're looking for runs all around the area I sell you working now with staff with Steph curry most recently how do you get into a game like that %HESITATION well someone had just one of the guys who work for the warriors is like %HESITATION you know northern California we maybe setting up some pick up runs are you interested in %HESITATION and so I said yeah I'm definitely you know looking for some of the best players to play again no staff and some of the other guys are out there and next thing you know you know talking to my former teammates as well and you know got a chance to play again you know it probably fifteen twenty NBA players you know I think that's probably the biggest thing that I kind of learned during my year in China was that it doesn't really matter when or where you step on the court like for me I know what Jamie Lynn basketball is and I know the mindset that I need to have been so whether it's %HESITATION pick up run %HESITATION against zero pros whether to pick up run against some of the best N. B. A. players whether it's a game in China or whether it's a game in the NBA doesn't really matter for me I feel like my mindset has come such a long way %HESITATION and so for me like every time I step on the floor I'm just like look I'm gonna play my brand of basketball so I think the last time most NBA fans saw you was with the raptors and it was a great time right you win the title in twenty nineteen but the sort of wrinkle there of course is that you don't play a ton of minutes but you are this presence that people really did appreciate seeing and also having around on this incredibly wild ride so what stands out from that experience to you %HESITATION what honestly what stands out well one rocker stand are amazing and operated every the whole thing was ridiculous but what really stands out when it's hot when I think about it personally it's like when I look back on my time there I was I I just felt like I was a shell of myself uhhuh like I I felt like my tank was half empty you know the best analogy is when you when you try to shoot a shot if you're like hoping that it goes in and praying that it goes in like you're probably not going to make that many shot %HESITATION if you shoot a shot like a hundred percent no waiting and believing that it's going in that's gonna be such a difference in your mentality in the percentage and the title shot that you take I would say that was the start of this process of me coming face to face with your mental game isn't where it needs to be uhhuh and that's why I never realized right like going through what I went through those injuries it was like you you folks on the physical everyone talks on the physical %HESITATION the need to hamstring the whatever you know how's that doing what your range of motion I didn't understand what happened in terms of my mindset so in the summer of twenty nineteen you've now got this championship ring but you're also a free agent Jeremy and you don't let a contract with the new NBA team but you sign with the Beijing docks in the CBA in China and that the league to be clear that American fans really only know because some retired NBA guys go over there once their careers here are basically over but when you arrive you're a total star in China %HESITATION and also this total target what was the game like for you in the C. B. S. basically what happened in the CPA was O. double team triple team and I was game knocked and and you know the game itself is good people understand how physical the game is over there but I went through everything with the ball in my hands playing forty minutes a night and just having the result whether you win or lose B. on my shoulders and I needed that so badly just yep just give my flag in my mental game back and so how do I compare who I am today verses where I was when I was at the raptor's yeah I'm not player that is going to shoot knowing and believing like look I'm an NBA player I belong to and be a floor and I know exactly what I can do and and that's what and that's what China did to me it was just such incredible fanfare and then that's one thing and I was a dream I always had was to go and play in China and in the plan for the fans and I so glad I got to experience that on the other hand though the players like everyone wanted a piece of me and that's as a competitor that's what we want like we want everyone's best shot and that's what makes it fun for me is like %HESITATION I come to the gym everyone to take my hat off and so %HESITATION it's it's a it's a dichotomy because you know on one on one hand from the fans it's like you received so much love but every time you step on the floor it's it's like war but it's not just you learning about your game on the court in China %HESITATION that sticks out Jeremy you also began to dig pretty deep into the emotions behind the huge ups and downs of your career and I saw this video and this story that surfaced about you speaking at a church in Taiwan where your family's from and you were really on sparing about what it felt like to not land with an NBA team that year regency is into is I feel like in in some ways the NBA's kind of given up on me %HESITATION you can choose how did that talked in Taiwan come about so I I always share my testimony and and last year you know it just happened to come at a really tough time and for me the one thing that I felt like would be the boldest thing to do was to Cher honestly uhhuh and I'm kind of somebody who you know I don't it's not comfortable right like it's not comfortable for me to share that **** bleak but also at the same time I knew that that's what I should do and so when I was going through a rough moment in a rough patch last summer I was just hoping about it in English is saying it is once you hit rock bottom the only way the bottom just seems to keep getting more more about me trust me it took a lot and I had to really think about it because I knew generally what the reaction was going to be that it would open myself up to you know potential criticism but to me that last year was a launch pad for me to start taking my fears and one of my fears was well what happens if I am going to bowl with the world and it's in home and life is or isn't in the house you know it's the most powerful thing I can do is not to be a great player on the court but to get up here and here every last one of my failures with you doing look there's these ways that I was you know playing to not lose versus playing to win and I was one of those big three %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION okay I want to take a quick break with you here and then we're going to jump back to two thousand and twelve the seven game stretch that made you this household name and everything else that's happened to you since from the moment they're born you do everything to keep your kids safe but who's looking out for you as you look out for them B. Volvo XC ninety SUV with advanced safety technology helps look after you from the standard blind spot information system that watches your sides you can steer you away from merging traffic to standard cross traffic alert with auto break that watches your back and can automatically apply the brakes for people and on coming traffic as you reverse it's nice to know that someone is looking out for you the XC ninety for everyone's safety visit Volvo cars dot com slash U. S. to learn more in New York City we're going story of Jeremy Lin sure so Jeremy for those who are somehow on familiar February two thousand and twelve injuries to your next teammates land you in the starting line up for the first time and crazy things start to happen please leave a phone number no we in a twelve day span you end up leading the next to seven straight wins the average twenty four points and nine assists a game it's a great historian sports right now and with that being the greatest stories sports of course people are going to want to see like C. open source we zero point zero I remember the last time we sat down and talked you having like something of a delicate even complicated relationship with even the word Lynn sanity and it kind of reminded me of like you know this member of a boy band almost to go down the whole solo career and doesn't want to keep reliving the past and like it's so long ago but it's also the thing that you are most famous for like when did that slip for you what goes through your mind when you hear that word now when when did it change you know like you said %HESITATION when I used to hear the word and B. L. A. I would cringe out run for me and I would say about like four years ago is when I was like you know I'm going to just embrace it %HESITATION because that was such a special moment in time at that moment I didn't really realize the impact that I have %HESITATION I just was so afraid that I didn't want that to be like the pinnacle or the only thing that people knew me for %HESITATION when I hear that Danny I don't even think of myself I think of like you know a a period of time or like this %HESITATION moment or this figure that everyone else wanted me to be I'm comfortable in my own skin now like and I know who I am as a player today and you know this is gonna be crazy %HESITATION you know this is going to sound crazy to you but I I genuinely think %HESITATION I'm better now than I was then you know when I look back on my high like back then I was really one dimensional back that in certain things so many things that I can do now that I've worked so hard on that I couldn't do that and whether it's going left whether it's playing defense whether it's you know shooting the floater or shooting the mid range or even shooting off the dribble three in terms of like your shot man I mean I solve recent video of it and you're right it looks entirely different how would you describe what he used to look like versus what it looks like now mmhm okay that's me tough what it used to look like I'm literally doing the motion right now and I'm trying to describe it my mobile is way higher and way out to the right and the ball is probably like six to nine inches higher on my old shot and now it's become way more effortless and way more smooth it it it looks so much like one motion verses before it looked really hit C. like almost like a Seve or catapult that's also the reason why I like for me when I hear the word of sanity it doesn't like I don't cringe anymore I'm like look that was a huge part of who I am but like you know I I I seriously feel like in terms of me and who I am as a player the best is still to come and and I also might sound crazy to other people because like %HESITATION well you just turned thirty two but I'm like I don't even have to try to be Lynn sanity like I'm really comfortable with where I'm at today something that's so crazy to me Jeremy is that at the time of that run what you most seem to me from the outside was wildly wildly confident I mean the Valentine's day game shot against the raptors the thirty eight points against Colby did it feel like confidence at the time or were you sort of just running through at and it was also much they didn't have time to really be contemplating how you were feeling when I think about that time confident it's not the first word that comes comes to my mind uhhuh but was that confident absolutely but I was also like almost blacked out during the game right was like whether I made a good play or not it didn't matter because the ball was it back in my hands no I had three turnovers in a row and the ball will come back into my hand that I had to go make another play I didn't have time and I was just so immersed in the moment that I was like flowing industry flowing state right yeah what's the difference today is the reason why I actually feel I'm probably more confident today is because there's I've seen anticipation the visualization of what I feel like I can do concretely yeah it felt like you know thinking back on it now I felt like that scene in the movie were like one of the super heroes discovers their powers for the first time and they're kind of like going nuts and there's some turnovers here and there but like these moments that gives everybody goose bumps and I I want to ask you this too because those goose bumps are still like they're still palpable in the mind of new Yorkers do you have a fondness for the city of New York because they feel like you're still like you could run for mayor here man like I feel like there is still this affection for that time like nothing's really been better than that short lived span of time in February of two thousand and twelve I have so much love for New York and and %HESITATION man you know this past year and went over and New York was going through it really really really badly %HESITATION when the Knicks reached out %HESITATION they could have rebroadcast it anything in the one thing they want to re broadcasting the toughest time Derek Colbert was named sanity week yeah just me I I I I and I'm like I was blown away when they sounds like what you had so many players you ing and sorry you know although lawyers it's like but you want to broadcast with any week and so for me it's like Matt I have a lot of love for New York no question what's your favorite moment or game on the court from that run that when you look back and you allow yourself to relive what you were like in that time that you think yourself man that's the one that's it %HESITATION the Laker game for multiple reasons I was just so fired up because %HESITATION you know the whole lead out that build up to the to the game in the trash talking and everything else well to be clear about what that was for those who do not remember the leader there was that the late great Kobe Bryant profess to be unaware of this hot streak you were on which also happened to be the number one sports story in the world at the time yeah I know yes but I don't really know what's going on I don't even know what he's doing why do you know what you guys are talking about and that was the pretext for the climax of Lynn sanity yeah yeah that's what ended up happening I saw that interview in a taxi cab over to the game and so my mind set looks like a %HESITATION a be so aggressive so address it tonight and if I have space is going up and if they press up I'm going by them you had to ask all these different questions you go through the injuries you go to failures and that for me is like where I'm at right now it's like I feel that exact same mentality and I went into that Laker game and that's why it resonate that game resonates so much with me right now where it's like like a transgression and purity and simplicity to it %HESITATION %HESITATION all right one more break here and then we're going to get into how you dealt with leaving China and all your fame there behind %HESITATION there are a lot of reasons to like eighteen T. five G. for example Lisa who's a professional race car driver and based jump wing student easiest legs eighteen T. five G. because it's fast and then there's Terry who's a bodyguard who once wrestled a high you know when it got too close to his client on safari Terry like eighteen P. five G. because it's secure and take Sasha who's a librarian and hasn't missed a day of work in twenty seven years not even that time she broke both her legs and had the measles she was eighteen T. five G. because it's reliable switch to eighteen T. five G. it's fast secure and reliable end now with nationwide eighteen T. five G. it's not complicated five G. requires a compatible plan five G. may not be in your area C. A. T. and T. dot com slash five G. for you for five G. coverage details I mean I can sense the enthusiasm the genuine passion and excitement that you have about getting back on the court and I think of a quote that Mike d'antoni your coach of course with the next what he once told me about you you said you give him the confidence that comes with not looking over your shoulder and you get the special qualities he's shown his whole life great great things can happen what goes through your mind when you hear that quote during that call it's like wow I just went through time she you know I I talked to him in in my my mom still keeps in touch with his wife I mean I'm sick of forever bond that we're going to have %HESITATION but when I hear that quote I've always known that when I don't have to look over my shoulder or when it seems like something is given to me like I have the ultimate green light and I had everyone around me that I can always excel and play and show the fullness of who I am and the player but then on the flip side when I was younger the thing I really struggled with what if I had to look over my shoulder and if I wasn't sure that people around me were confident in me I would shrink that's what we saunter in place with on Toronto it wasn't maybe about a lot of people would maybe more about me and whether I trusted myself and it whether I trust my body in my knee and different things like that so being that I've really been going towards in terms of the new mine is I hate when that confidence is not handed to me can I still play with the confidence had already been handed to me %HESITATION that's what I've been working at and that's what I've learned and that's what I feel like I got to in China and that's why that quote it's like I love that quote but I'm also like you know what even if it's not given to me %HESITATION I'm going to play like like it already has been given to me you have summarize it so well just then but it makes me think also like take me back to the decision to leave China after a year and try to come back to the league yeah I mean you know I I made that decision two months ago and I I spent three weeks trying to make that decision and I and it was really got wrenching decision %HESITATION I love the fans so much and what they've done for me and the league was great to me that everything about last season was great for me but here in this moment we're at right now like where my heart is just like no I know what I'm capable of doing and so I got to go and do it so now you leave the world of hotel lobbies that are over run with hundreds of fans were literally pawing at your shirt you leave the world of being this one man beetle mania and you end up back in the bay where it all starts man like this is full circle by definition you are here to where you were right after we talked a decade ago your unsigned you're hoping that people appreciate and see the evolution that you've made what's that like man there's there's a beauty to it I %HESITATION I'm just a Hooper you know when I'm forty five when I'm fifty five like I'm going to be playing at the local like I'm going to be fighting the runs near me like that's just what I love to do there's beauty in the grind it out and %HESITATION and that's fine to me how does the pressure of being this figure to fans in America Asian American fans that bad idea that Hey man Jeremy Lin is our guy like to what extent is that motivates you to enter your brain how does that figure into all of this how answered that leads any question is also how I feel about that %HESITATION when I was younger I would always try to run from it because everyone wanted pigeon holed me into it it's like %HESITATION that's the reason I ask ball player and I just wanted to be like no that's really good basketball player yeah if we could replace Asian for like really good I would have been really happy but as I got older I started to realize like I don't have to be an insanity I don't have to be what everyone else is trying to label me and like I'm completely in breaking the fact that I'm Asian how to use my voice all the things that are going on in the world and and I wouldn't change that but at the same time I don't feel that burden %HESITATION that pressure %HESITATION what can you say about the rumors that we've been hearing about teams that are interested in you in the N. B. A. what can you say about how the process has gone in terms of finding a suitor who I believe is what you're saying that you are better than you've ever been before as a basketball player I I was talking bout with my family I thank kind of feels a little bit like when I was a dropped it right in the exact same position again today but again I'm not like trimming or worried I'm just like like I just need I just need to find that right opportunity and and the rest will take care of itself Jeremy Lin I really appreciate you being honestly more open and introspective than I've ever heard before and I look forward to watching you man get back to where you belong recientemente the merger %HESITATION hi Pablo torrei this has been yes P. N. daily I'll talk to you tomorrow
