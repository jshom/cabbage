# CABbAGE - Cognitive Computing RPI

## For dev

To start up run `make`, this will spin up a Jupyter notebook. All files will be
saved to the `./notebooks` directory.

Tensorflow, Keras and Numpy should all be pre-installed. The IBM Watson library should aso be installed.
    `pip install --upgrade "ibm-watson>=4.7.1"`

_NOTE: using the nightly tf jupyer notebook image, hoping it doesn't cause any issues_
